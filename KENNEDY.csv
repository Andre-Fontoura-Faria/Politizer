Kennedy Jr., is polling close to 20 percent in some Democratic primary surveys.A USA TODAY/Suffolk University Poll published on April 19 had him at 14 percent, with New Age guru Marianne Williamson garnering 5 percent support. Since then, a more recent Emerson College poll has him at 21 percent, while Williamson is at 8 percent. And a Fox News poll has him at 19 percent, with Williamson at 9 percent.While it seems highly unlikely that Kennedy, who recently launched his campaign to challenge President Joe Biden, will play a decisive role in the 2024 election, he could potentially embarrass the president (probably not to the degree his famous uncle, Sen. Ted Kennedy, embarrassed then-President Jimmy Carter in the 1980 primary—but surely no incumbent president wants to find a Kennedy in the primary soup).Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,Yes,15.50451791631528,95.43485361361726,98.9766193116013,76.9117210271029,94.00114807104268,98.95072105282867,rfk jr.,{},"{'activist': 'vaccine', 'surveys': 'primary', 'poll': 'recent', 'role': 'decisive', 'uncle': 'famous', 'president': 'incumbent', 'soup).read': 'primary'}",0,0

As one of the nations least responsible for this crisis, Fiji highlighted the devastating loss and damage they are already facing due to rising sea levels and extreme weather events, calling on nations to urgently join a bloc of Pacific Island nation states in starting discussions for a new treaty.Joseph Sikulu, 350.org Pacific Managing Director says,“We welcome Fiji’s support of the Fossil Fuel Non-Proliferation Treaty and the call for an urgent phase out of fossil fuels globally.

Donald Trump""","Free Speech For People, a non-profit organization dedicated to protecting and defending democracy and our Constitution, sent a letter today to Chief Judge Cecilia M. Altonaga of the US District Court for the Southern District of Florida urging her to exercise her authority under federal law and internal court procedure to reassign the case of United States v. Donald Trump, if Judge Aileen M. Cannon fails to recuse herself within 10 days. As highlighted in the letter, Judge Cannon has demonstrated extreme bias, resulting in significant judicial error, in a previous decision related to the investigation and evidence involved in this case. Allowing Judge Cannon to preside over the current case without addressing these concerns would undermine the court's impartiality and erode public confidence in the proceedings. The letter references Judge Cannon's ruling, which was later reversed, involving the government's examination of national defense materials seized from Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago compound pursuant to a lawful search warrant signed by a federal magistrate judge. In her widely-criticized (and ultimately reversed) ruling, Judge Cannon purported to extend the court's jurisdiction over the matter, appointing a special master and blocking any further investigation by the government. The letter points out that Judge Cannon's order reflected a biased approach by considering Trump's status as a former president and prioritizing reputational harm to Trump over equal justice before the law. The Eleventh Circuit, in a unanimous decision, strongly criticized Judge Cannon's ruling, calling it a ""radical reordering of our case law"" and emphasizing the violation of separation-of-powers limitations.

61,Kennedy,2023-06-14,"""Sanders, Jayapal and Colleagues Introduce Legislation to Make College Tuition- and Debt-Free for Working Families""","Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), chairman of the Senate Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee, today with Congresswoman Pramila Jayapal (D-Wash.) and eight colleagues in the Senate, introduced historic legislation that would open up the dream of a college degree to millions of working-class children across the country. As millions of Americans face uncertainty around their federal student loan debt, the College for All Act of 2023 allows students to attend public colleges and universities tuition- and debt-free. It also ensures that the vast majority of students who enroll at Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs), Asian American and Native American Pacific Islander Serving Institutions (AANAPISIs), and other Minority-Serving Institutions (MSIs) can attend tuition- and debt-free. First introduced in 2015, the College for All Act of 2023 would be the most substantial expansion of higher education access since the Great Society and President Lyndon B. Johnson’s Higher Education Act of 1965. Joining Sanders and Jayapal on the legislation in the Senate are Sens. Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Edward Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.). and Peter Welch (D-Vt.). “Today, this country tells young people to get the best education they can, and then saddles them for decades with crushing student loan debt. To my mind, that does not make any sense whatsoever,” said Sanders. “In the wealthiest country in the history of the world, a higher education should be a right for all, not a privilege for the few. It is absolutely unacceptable that hundreds of thousands of bright young Americans do not get a higher education each year, not because they are unqualified, but because their family does not have enough money. In the 21st century, a free public education system that goes from kindergarten through high school is no longer good enough. The time is long overdue to make public colleges and universities tuition-free and debt-free for working families. Education is one of the keys to a successful democracy and we must make it easier, not harder, for young people to obtain the degrees they have worked so hard for.” “As millions of borrowers wait in limbo to see if the Supreme Court will allow President Biden’s student debt cancellation plan to lift millions out of debt, Congress must work to ensure that working families never have to take out these crushing loans in the first place,” said Jayapal. “I’m proud to lead this legislation with Senator Sanders that would free students from a lifetime of debt and transform our country’s higher education system by ensuring that everyone can afford to pursue a college degree.” This legislation would guarantee tuition-free community college for all students and allow students from single households earning up to $125,000 a year, and married households earning up to $250,000 a year, to attend college without fear of being saddled with student loan debt. If passed, the College for All Act would also: Double the maximum Pell Grant award: $7,395 to $14,790 for the 2024-2025 school year for students enrolled at public and private non-profit colleges;Establish a $10 billion grant program for states participating in the federal-state partnership to scale evidence-based practices and strategies;Triple Federal TRIO funding from $1.191 billion in FY23 to $3 billion in FY24;Double GEAR UP funding from $388 million in FY23 to $736 million in FY24; andDouble mandatory funding for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, Tribal Colleges and Universities, and other Minority-Serving institutions. College for All is paid for by the Tax on Wall Street Speculation Act of 2023 – also introduced today by Sanders and Rep. Barbara Lee (D-Calif.) – which puts a tax of 0.5 percent on stock trades, a 0.1 percent fee on bonds, and a 0.005 percent fee on derivatives and other financial instruments. Today, dozens of countries have imposed a financial transactions tax including the United Kingdom, Germany, France, Switzerland, China, India, South Korea, Hong Kong, Singapore, Taiwan, and Brazil. The U.S. also had a Wall Street speculation tax from 1914 to 1966. In 1914, the tax was 0.02 percent on sales or transfers of stock. In 1932, Congress more than doubled that tax to help finance the government during the Great Depression. Economic analysis on this proposal has estimated that it would raise $220 billion per year or well over $2 trillion over 10 years.

119,Kennedy,2023-06-26,"""Shirtless and in jeans, RFK Jr’s workout videos are captivating the internet""","A shirtless, be-denimed Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is all over Twitter, trying to prove he is fit to be the next president. The 2024 Democratic candidate posted a video of himself doing push-ups on Sunday with the caption “getting in shape for my debates with President Biden!” https://twitter.com/RobertKennedyJr/status/1673053159172833280 The push-up video followed a separate post of RFK Jr. lifting weights on Saturday. ""No one lifting shirtless in sun with jeans, tuned up on TRT, would ever betray this great country,"" wrote right-wing influencer Mike Cernovich. https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/1672716516721319938 The videos drew both praise and mockery, as well as an onslaught of criticism of President Joe Biden’s fitness, whose health has continually been called into question. A recent NBC News poll found that more than two-thirds of respondents are concerned about Biden’s mental and physical health as president, with 55% having “major” concerns. “The only time Biden does a push up is when he ‘pushes himself up’ off the floor after falling down,” quipped one user, referencing Biden’s recent tumble. https://twitter.com/stephwilkens/status/1673056079637368835 “RFK Jr. is probably the most jacked presidential candidate we’ve ever had,” commented another. https://twitter.com/sovereignbrah/status/1672722671694675968 However, the 69-year-old candidate’s push-up video also drew some snide remarks about him doing less than ten push-ups, prompting him to later clarify: “I can do more than 10 pushups. That was my last set.” The video also prompted calls for a Biden-RFK Jr. push-up competition, given Biden’s past jokes about push-ups. In 2019, Biden joked that if former President Donald Trump attacked him over his age, he’d say, ‘Come on Donald, come on man. How many push-ups do you want to do here, pal?’” He also challenged an Iowa voter who confronted him during a campaign stop to a push-up competition. “If Biden won’t debate Kennedy, he should at least do one of those push-up contests he loves to challenge random voters to,” wrote one user. https://twitter.com/GraduatedBen/status/1673059287252205570 https://twitter.com/joelpollak/status/1673095885247356930 “Politics would 100% be more interesting if our leaders were decided over a death match in an arena,” joked another. “Replace the electoral college with a decathlon,” proposed another. While RFK Jr. is captivating the internet’s attention for his push-ups, he’s also going viral for a number of absurd, incorrect anti-vax statements. A recent appearance on Joe Rogan’s podcast sparked outrage and led to a doctor being harassed online for over a week. And while RFK Jr. has been pushing for Biden to debate him, it’s unlikely the president would debate any challengers as he seeks the Democratic re-nomination for president in 2024, shirtless or otherwise.

Subscribe here and send your questions, tips, and complaints here.EXCLUSIVE — FOX’S MAGA YOUTH BREAK-UP: Months after fully severing ties with CPAC, Fox News appears to have distanced itself from another major conservative powerhouse: Turning Point USA. In years past, the cable network maintained a close, nearly symbiotic relationship with the Charlie Kirk-led MAGA student group, with Fox News stars regularly appearing at TPUSA events and Fox Nation livestreaming the entirety of the org’s Student Action Summit and Americafest events, including an All Access Live broadcast in 2021 hosted by Fox stars Kayleigh McEnany and Pete Hegseth. However, as Kirk unveils his big 2023 confab for this upcoming weekend, Fox News is notably absent from the speakers roster, has done no advance hyping of the event, and will not be live-streaming it. “Fox’s relationship with Turning Point is basically over,” a Fox News insider told Confider. “They don’t want their talent associated with them anymore.” The inaugural Turning Point Action Conference, aka ActCon, which is hosted by TPUSA’s political advocacy arm and begins Saturday in Palm Beach, will feature a bevy of GOP presidential candidates and lawmakers along with right-wing pundits, including former Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Dan Bongino, both of whom exited the network in April. But not a single Fox News star is set to appear at this moment. Fox News, like any cable network, could very well cover a moment or two from the event should it warrant their attention, but the network’s absence constitutes a remarkable change for both parties: Over the past two years, Turning Point’s biggest annual events have been Fox-heavy affairs featuring the Hegseth and McEnany broadcasts as well as much-hyped speeches from Carlson, Jesse Watters, Greg Gutfeld, Jeanine Pirro, and Laura Ingraham. (Ingraham was the only Fox personality to speak at TPUSA’s women’s summit last month, but the group did not actively promote her speech on its website.) So what’s behind the network apparently ghosting Turning Point? Semafor reported last week that the network is wary about letting its stars appear at conservative events with known election deniers and conspiracy theorists in the wake of Fox’s massive $787.5-million settlement with Dominion. For example, Fox has discouraged Pirro, who was prominently named in the Dominion lawsuit, from speaking at a TPUSA event and a church service to promote her latest book. Further suggesting a link between Dominion and Fox’s break-up with TPUSA is the fact that ActCon 2023’s keynote speaker is Donald Trump, whose election lies directly led to Fox’s Dominion mess. (Trump will appear this weekend on Fox’s air, however, in a more controlled environment, via a sitdown interview with Maria Bartiromo.) Other 2020 deniers and Jan. 6 organizers scheduled for ActCon speeches include Mike Lindell, Patrick Byrne, and Steve Bannon. Furthermore, Kirk himself has been outspoken in his belief that the 2020 vote was “stolen“ from Trump. Neither Fox News nor TPUSA responded to requests for comment.Tips?

Kennedy Jr. generated outrage last week by conspiratorially suggesting that COVID-19 may have been “ethnically targeted” to “attack Caucasians and Black people” while disproportionately sparing Chinese people and Ashkenazi Jews. But his celebrity wife, Emmy-nominated actress Cheryl Hines, doesn’t want to talk about that.The Curb Your Enthusiasm star has taken a monastic vow of silence in regard to her husband’s combustible claims, even as his own family members rebuke him. As her spokeswoman explained to The Daily Beast, Hines is simply receiving too many “daily requests” to weigh in. (Kennedy later insisted that his comments about the coronavirus—which were captured on video—were taken out of context.)Instead, the spokeswoman directed The Daily Beast to a profile of Hines that appeared in The New York Times style section last month. The article was intermittently flattering and skeptical; on more than one occasion, the author called Hines’ answers vague or difficult to parse, including in response to some questions about her views on vaccines. (Asked how she and her husband diverge politically, Hines paused for 49 seconds but did not come up with “a clear answer,” the paper reported.)Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,Yes,13.667411649511507,76.0757228723513,100.0,32.99510973861984,69.29249218339187,89.02127379215054,cheryl hines,{},"{'candidate': 'gettypresidential', 'week': 'last', 'people': 'chinese', 'actress': 'nominated', 'vow': 'monastic', 'claims': 'combustible', 'members': 'own', 'requests': 'daily', 'month': 'last', 'answer': 'clear'}",0,0

Kennedy Jr.’s suggestion that COVID-19 may have been maliciously engineered to spare Jewish and Chinese people was many things—but surprising wasn’t one of them. As unhinged as the mind of a conspiracy theorist may be, it can always be trusted, sooner or later, to land on the Jews. And that’s just what the Democratic presidential candidate did at a Manhattan dinner last week when offering his thoughts on the virus’s origins. “There is an argument that it is ethnically targeted. COVID-19 attacks certain races disproportionately,” he explained. “COVID-19 is targeted to attack Caucasians and Black people. The people who are most immune are Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese.” Of course, he belatedly conceded, “we don’t know whether it was deliberately targeted or not.”Evidently, Kennedy isn’t bothered by the fact that COVID has killed between 1 and 1.5 million people in China, nor its devastating impact on Jewish communities. But facts are of little import to a man who believes the CIA was behind his uncle’s and father’s murders; blamed vaccines for a rise in autism; accused the Republican Party of mounting “a massive, coordinated campaign to subvert the will of the people” in stealing the 2004 presidential election from John Kerry; claimed 5G internet towers are being used “to harvest our data and control our behavior”; and said that Wi-Fi breaches “the blood-brain barrier” and causes “leaky brain.”Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,Yes,13.667411649511507,12.486863634509865,99.9982477385626,32.99510973861984,69.29249218339187,89.02127379215054,rfk jr.,{},"{'people': 'black', 'things': 'many', 'candidate': 'presidential', 'week': 'last', 'races': 'certain', 'impact': 'devastating', 'communities': 'jewish', 'import': 'little', 'campaign': 'coordinated', 'election': 'presidential'}",0,0

374,Kennedy,2023-07-25,"""‘I soon learned, if you have an opinion the left doesn’t like—you will be harassed’: Twitter icon Catturd, a Trump favorite, revealed""","The Florida sun was blazing when I pulled into the driveway of one of the most famous and mysterious conservative internet personalities in America. A white pickup truck coming up the lane quickly reversed toward the house at the sight of my car. The truck then stopped abruptly and honked, so I pulled to the side, got out, and started toward it. The driver leaned on the horn and a woman inside yelled out the window, “You’re on private property!”  The truck raced back to the residence the owner fondly refers to as Catturd Ranch. This is the closest any reporter has gotten to Catturd, the right-wing internet personality who glibly describes himself as “the turd you can’t flush.” In five short years, he’s gone from an unknown fecal-themed member of the MAGA reply guys to a powerhouse influencer. His missives have solicited responses from the likes of Elon Musk and are frequently reposted by former President Donald Trump. Yet, despite his fame and nearly 2 million Twitter followers, 1 million Truth Social followers, and hundreds of thousands who have listened to his podcast, Catturd remains largely a mystery. Even as he became famous—or infamous, depending on your perspective—Catturd managed to keep his real name a secret for years. Then, in early 2023, the QAnon Anonymous podcast, after following up reporting by Rolling Stone, revealed that the man behind the internet fursona is Phillip Buchanan, a 58-year-old white guy who lives in a rural part of the Florida panhandle. On a recent trip to his hometown, the Daily Dot learned that Buchanan’s preference for anonymity extends to the place he’s called home since 2018. Almost nobody there has any idea who he is—in real life or online. And that’s just how he likes it. Over the years, Buchanan has consistently refused to speak to media outside his right-wing bubble. He routinely ignores interview requests, claims he doesn’t care what people think of him, and says he rarely reads coverage of him because it’s “boring.” My visit prompted the man best known as Catturd to break from his longstanding refusal to open up to media he perceives as liberal. The morning after our encounter in his driveway, Buchanan agreed to answer the Daily Dot’s questions via email. In his response to an inquiry I sent via his website, he came across as angry and afraid, yet concerned for my safety and that of his six dogs. He also threatened to call the police. “I don't like being harassed at my private home. I've been doxed so many times by the left and right, I have a constant flow of people pulling over, taking pictures, even leaving death threats in my mailbox,” Buchanan wrote. Buchanan said strangers aren’t ever allowed on his property, in part because he likes his privacy and in part because he rescues dogs that have been abandoned and mistreated. “If you open the gate, one could run down and bite—the others would run out of the gate and could be easily killed on that dangerous road,” Buchanan wrote. “You also don't need to be pulling out on that road in a hurry then braking suddenly,” he added. (I initially wasn’t sure it was the right house and turned around to circle back.) “I don't want to see you get hurt. That road is extremely dangerous so be careful.” He went on to say he’d be “shocked” if this wasn’t a “hit piece,” but said he’d give me a chance anyway. “There's no need to try to ambush me or follow me around. If I'm harassed in any way the next few days, I'll call the local cops and let them handle it—and I don't want to do that,” he wrote. “I don't like being like this, but I also don't like feeling like a prisoner in my own home. Please respect my boundaries and I'll respect yours.” He signed the email “Catturd.” The gate to his driveway was shut every time I drove past on the way to or from town throughout the rest of my stay. The land of Catturd and honey With fewer than 30 people per square mile, Gulf County is one of the most rural parts of Florida. The Apalachicola River snakes through the county and into the Gulf of Mexico, producing the oysters and honey for which Florida is renowned. Like its famous yet anonymous resident, Gulf County exists in two worlds. It’s the only county in Florida—and one of only nine in America—that’s in two time zones: Eastern and Central. Wewahitchka, the part of the county where Catturd lives, is best known for the Dead Lakes and Tupelo honey that’s harvested there. The town of 2,000 people is a speck surrounded by woods and water; “Wewahitchka” translates to “water eyes” in Seminole. Local beekeepers sell honey alongside seafood and other wares at roadside shops and stores like the Dixie Dandy, a combination gas station, grocery store, and restaurant. The local coffee shop, Birdie’s Brew, serves some drinks with honey. One person said “everything is honey” in Wewahitchka. If they don’t work at a shop in town or for themselves, a librarian said that most people in town work at the school, prison, or Deseret Cattle & Timber—hence the logging trucks Buchanan warned about. It’s not the kind of place where one expects to rub elbows with celebrities, but Wewahitchka, which locals simply call Wewa, has had a few famous residents. Country music legend Hank Williams Jr. had a place on the river where he’d host parties that residents say were as rowdy as his songs promised. New York Times bestselling mystery novelist Michael Lister lives in Wewa. Much of the 1997 film about a beekeeper, Ulee’s Gold, which earned Peter Fonda an Oscar nomination, was filmed there. Although he’s got millions of followers, Buchanan is unknown in his own community. Only one of the dozens of locals the Daily Dot interviewed over several days had ever heard of him. Adam, a middle-aged man working the counter at a business in Wewa, asked about the story after spotting my press badge. He broke into a broad grin at the name “Phillip Buchanan.” “Oh, yeah, Catturd,” Adam said.  He said that Buchanan is a “pretty good guy” who will talk a blue streak about politics if you get him going. “You’d never think someone [that famous] would live in Wewa,” Adam added, shaking his head. Everyone else was surprised to learn that they live down the road from a man so well-known in right-wing political circles that Trump sent him a get-well card when he was in the hospital last year. The bartender at local watering hole Pub 71 read Buchanan’s Wikipedia page and said it made him sound “like an a**hole.” “He wouldn’t come here then, because we’re bigger a**holes,” she added with a smile. A regular sitting at the bar with his dog in his lap agreed. “That name don’t ring no bells,” said one of the two officers manning the door at the Gulf County Courthouse in nearby Port St. Joe. They were amazed to learn that a celebrity of his stature lives in Wewa. They gathered around the front desk computer to look him up and see where he lives. “Honeyville’s a real close-knit community,” the first officer said, referring to the part of Wewa that Buchanan calls home. He opined that it’s weird to be a public figure on the internet and practically invisible in your hometown. After thinking about it for a few minutes, he said he seemed to recall Buchanan had black Labrador retrievers when he first moved in. The same scenario played out at the library, in local businesses, and at a meeting of the Gulf County Democratic Party. The dozen people who attended the meeting were so curious they requested a brief speech about Catturd. Upon learning that Buchanan wrote science fiction novels, both librarians went hunting the stacks for a sci-fi book by a local writer whose first name is Phillip. The author turned out to have a different last name. In a town where everybody knows everybody, almost no one knows Catturd. And that’s just how Buchanan likes it. “I mainly keep to myself and hardly anyone in my small town knows who I am, and probably wouldn't care if they did,” he said in an email. He also said he doesn’t get involved in local politics because he wants his home to be a “sanctuary” from the political arena. From the Groovy Grapes to Twitter Buchanan spent his twenties and thirties trying to find his place in the world—with limited success. Multiple marriages didn’t work out. Playing guitar and singing in a rock band called the Groovy Grapes didn’t quite work out either. Rolling Stone reports that the producers who worked on Beck’s Odelay were interested in Buchanan’s band and its mid-'90s, grunge-infused rock. https://youtu.be/u4pSXJQWE8w In 2018, not long after he bought a two-bedroom house in Wewa, Buchanan, then 54, unexpectedly stumbled onto the gig that would make him famous. That fall, he created a Twitter account with the handle @Catturd2. Via email, Buchanan said he’d lurked on Twitter for years until a deeply felt personal loss inspired him to start tweeting. “After a lifetime of playing guitar and slinging hammers, using power tools, and working hard—out of the blue, I developed bad arthritis in my fingers. It started with my index fingers and in the period of a few short months, I sadly lost the ability to play guitar,” he wrote. “This was a huge blow to me—I was lost.” Music had been a part of his life since childhood, he said. His days of playing in the Groovy Grapes were long gone, but he still enjoyed spending evenings writing songs with his guitar. Seeking a creative outlet, he turned to writing sci-fi and tweeting. His Twitter presence was heavily political from the start. Buchanan also shied away from local issues. On Oct. 10, 2018, the day Hurricane Michael tore through Gulf County as a Category 5 storm with 160 mile-an-hour winds, Buchanan tweeted, “Goodnight folks… Always remember. Obama hates the USA. Hillary uses the USA[.] Trump loves the USA.” He would later document the damage the hurricane wrought.  By quote-tweeting people like conspiratorial far-right troll Jack Posobiec and conservative pundit Dan Bongino and penning tweets in his caustic, unfiltered style, Catturd swiftly gained Twitter followers, bringing him both acclaim and hatred. Within months of creating the account, Buchanan was getting retweeted by some of the most prominent conservative influencers online. His tweets about election fraud in 2020, a claim he keeps hammering to this day, catapulted him to the pinnacle of right-wing retweets: Trump himself. (There is no credible evidence that fraud affected the election outcome.) Today, there are entire accounts dedicated to loving—and loathing—him. His following is impressively built as a textbook reply guy who sticks to two subjects—politics and his pets—and there’s no indication that Buchanan inflated his follower count inorganically, though he does increase his reach by subscribing to Twitter Blue. But he did not answer when this reporter asked if he was paid to tweet. As Catturd, Buchanan often comes across as venomous and angry—except when he writes about his animals. His posts about his six cats and six dogs stand in sharp contrast to tweets declaring “dumbf*cks vote blue” and calling Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) a “little b*tch” for not supporting America first candidates who support isolationist policies, such as no longer meddling in foreign affairs, providing international aid, and belonging to treaty organizations like the United Nations and the World Health Organization. He once retweeted a photoshopped sexual image of President Joe Biden with his face buried in Ukrainian President Volodomyr Zelenskyy’s butt. A few tweets earlier, he shared a photo of his dog “mama Sweetie” feeding some of her 10 puppies while the others slept around her, their furry little bodies sated from mother’s milk. He told the Daily Dot that he dreams of turning his property into a sanctuary for abused and abandoned pets that he’d call the Catturd Rescue Ranch, “just because I think it’s funny.” “I'm trying to make enough money to be able to do this when I'm gone. It's the one thing I really want to leave behind,” he said. When he writes about the joy animals bring him, it’s almost possible to forget that Buchanan and Catturd are the same person. Yet the man who named a puppy “Wiggles” is the same person who recently called Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.’s nephew a “pathetic weasel” for condemning his uncle’s false claim that COVID-19 was designed to spare Ashkenazi Jews and Chinese people. Buchanan directs his ire, of which he has plenty, at Republicans, but he reserves his most scathing commentary for the other side of the aisle. He’s made something of a cottage industry of trolling Rep. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez (D-N.Y.). On a recent episode of his podcast, Live from the Litter Box with Jewels and Catturd, he called Attorney General Merrick Garland a “brown shirt Nazi,” and liberals “garbage, trash, scum,” saying of them, “I can’t stand you… At every step of your life, I hate you.” Via email, he said that his rant about hating Democrats wasn’t directed at individuals, but at their politics. In his view, calling liberals “trash” and saying he hates them is merely his way of disagreeing with their opinions. “For example, if someone tells me that men can have babies, I really don't care what that person has to say about anything forever. I won't participate in their delusions nor do I have time for justifying insanity,” he said. But Buchanan insists that he doesn’t categorically hate all liberals; he just despises their views. “I do, however, have a genuine love of people outside of politics and can keep the two issues separate,” Buchanan wrote. “I treat everyone with respect when I meet them and believe most people are genuinely good when you can get outside politics.” Buchanan also said he loathes both political parties and hates voting for the “worthless Republican Party” but feels the left is “so batsh*t crazy,” he doesn’t have any choice. He seems not to know or care that this is a similar refrain people on the left say about their political counterparts. https://twitter.com/catturd2/status/1680163479167156230?s=20 Buchanan frequently says that he has no idea why he has attracted millions of followers. He said he never expected to get more than a few hundred and attributes his success as Catturd to “blind luck.” He said he thinks it’s funny that people are so intrigued by him when he’s just a regular guy who shares his opinions, makes jokes, and posts about his pets. Buchanan conceded that the internet has changed his life in both good and bad ways, and said that being anonymous wasn’t really something he cared about so much as a gag that grew funnier the longer it lasted. “But I soon learned, if you have an opinion the left doesn't like—you will be harassed, stalked, your life threatened. You must be destroyed,” he said. “Some on the right did the same thing.” He may be one of the biggest conservative influencers online, but Buchanan doesn’t feel like he fits in with his cohorts. He said he doesn’t attend any of the many events he’s invited to because he’s “not a suit-and-tie guy” for whom taking selfies and hobnobbing at parties holds any appeal. To Buchanan, it’s weirder to post tons of selfies than it is to be simultaneously famous and invisible. “The truth is I enjoy playing with my dogs, going to the beach, being out in nature, or writing my stories, much more than going to a red carpet event—and it's not even close,” he said. “I guess if journalists wrote the real truth about me, nobody would want to read it. lol.” “I'm a mostly boring 58-year-old who doesn't care about wealth, fancy things, socializing 24/7, or being in the in-crowd.” That might be true in Wewa, but he clearly relishes being internet famous. He celebrates follower count milestones—he once tweeted about planning a music festival to celebrate reaching 1 million on Twitter, which he naturally called “Turdstock”—and told the Daily Dot he “absolutely adore[s]” his fans. He may have never expected to be famous, but Buchanan has gotten used to the trappings of fame. He was outraged when Twitter paid a portion of ad sales to influencers earlier this month, but left him out. https://www.twitter.com/catturd2/status/1679659435680059394?s=20 The influencer next door Even before he was outed by Rolling Stone—which spoke to an ex-wife who was surprised to learn that her musically gifted, handsome ex had become a MAGA influencer—and QAnon Anonymous—which exposed his real name and where he lives—Buchanan largely steered clear of his fellow townsfolk. On Feb. 20, 2021, he called the cops to report a potential threat to public safety. Records the Daily Dot obtained from the Gulf County Sheriff’s Office state that a Phillip Buchanan who lives at his address called the police a little after 6pm to report seeing a white male in a black hoodie near the drive-thru liquor store. The report states that Buchanan thought the male had a rifle, so he went home and called the cops. When the police arrived, they found a 13-year-old carrying a BB gun. They gave the boy and his uncle, who was with him, a verbal warning and sent them on their way. After calling the cops on the boy, he tweeted, “Are we having fun yet?” and lamented that he misses Rush Limbaugh “BAD.” If he got to know them, however, Buchanan would probably find he has much in common with people in Wewa, which local resident Brian, a military veteran who said he served in Iraq and Afghanistan, referred to as a “well-defined conglomerate of nobodies.” The town is filled with white, Christian, gun-owning Trump supporters just like him. Wewa is so steeped in Christianity that many businesses and the library are closed on Wednesdays because there’s church that night. Trump won three out of four votes in Gulf County in 2020. Today, plenty of houses proudly display Trump signs of both the official and handmade variety. On a recent summer afternoon, Wewahitchka Mayor Phillip Gaskin had just finished mowing grass by the Dead Lakes. Clad in overalls, with a hat and long sleeves to protect him from the merciless Florida sun, Gaskin was ready for cold beer and conversation. He apologized profusely for making an obscene gesture at the local carpenter giving me a tour of town with his little dog, JoJo.  “I didn’t know there was a lady in there,” he said more than once in a Southern twang that, coupled with his easy nature and working man attire, could make an outsider surprised to learn that he’s not only the mayor but also a mechanical engineer. Gaskin and the carpenter lingered between their trucks, swapping stories about Hurricane Michael, business, and the good times they had at a bait shop Gaskin ran before a bout with cancer. One boasted that the store sold more beer than any other establishment in town. Patrons had a tradition of buying rounds for the house; sometimes, there’d be upward of 30 people crammed inside, drinking beer and chewing the fat. Gaskin, a Republican who supports Trump but thinks he’d be better served by talking less and spending more time with his “beautiful wife,” was stunned to learn about his famous constituent. “I’m gonna look him up,” he said. If past is prologue, it’s not likely they’ll crack a joke or a cold one together anytime soon. For that, Buchanan would have to open his gate and let people in.
