As a sitting governor, DeSantis’ candidacy may implicate federal and state pay-to-play laws, including Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule 206(4)-5, Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) Rule G-37, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) Rule 23.451. Although Governor DeSantis is seeking federal office, his status as a state officeholder means that individuals and entities who engage in business activities covered by these rules may be subject to contribution limits significantly lower than the $3,300 per election limit that individuals may contribute to federal candidates under federal election laws.  Consequently, federal pay-to-play rules will likely present a fundraising challenge for Governor DeSantis’ presidential campaign, and necessitate compliance measures for the donors covered under these rules.  A single excessive contribution to DeSantis’ campaign by a covered employee could jeopardize a company’s ability to transact certain business with the state of Florida. For example, SEC Rule 206(4)-5 prohibits investment advisers from providing investment advisory services for compensation to a state or local government entity if the adviser, or a covered associate of the adviser, has made a political contribution to certain state or local government officials during the prior two years. Covered associates include general partners, managing members, executive officers of an investment adviser, employees who solicit a government entity for the investment adviser, and any persons who supervise such employees. The rule prohibits contributions to candidates for, and incumbents holding, any elective office which has the authority to directly or indirectly influence the hiring of an investment adviser or to appoint a person with such authority. Similarly, MSRB Rule G-37 prohibits brokers and dealers from engaging in municipal securities business with a municipal entity for compensation if the broker, dealer, or a covered associate has made a political contribution to an official with authority over dealer selection. Covered associates include municipal finance representatives, municipal solicitors, municipal finance principals, supervisors of any municipal finance principal, and members of a dealer’s executive or management committee. Also, CFTC Rule 23.451 restricts political contributions from swap dealers or their covered associates to officials responsible for hiring swap dealers to service state or local government clients for compensation. The same categories of associates covered under SEC Rule 206(4)-5 are covered for purposes of the CFTC rule.  Take note that PACs controlled by persons or entities covered under any of these pay-to-play rules are also covered.  The SEC and CFTC rules permit a de minimis contribution of up to $350 per election to covered officials for whom the contributor is entitled to. The MSRB rule allows for a de minimis contribution of up to $250 per election for covered individuals who are entitled to vote for the candidate.  The federal pay-to-play rules permit any covered individual in the country to contribute up to the applicable de minimis amount to presidential candidates.   Violations of applicable pay-to-play rules result in a two-year ban on providing advisory services for compensation to a government client.  Obtaining a refund of an excessive contribution does not absolve a violation, though federal regulators have the discretion to issue a waiver in the event of an excessive contribution.  The waiver process can be long, however, and there is no guarantee a waiver will ultimately be granted.  While limiting contributions to a presidential candidate may seem unusual, these issues frequently arise when state or local officeholders seek federal office. In 2016, covered associates were confronted with the same challenges regarding contributions to the Trump-Pence ticket before Mike Pence resigned as governor of Indiana. Former Governor Chris Christie’s 2016 presidential campaign faced the similar fundraising obstacles. Please note that federal pay-to-play rules also restrict contributions to certain state or local officeholders running for U.S. House or Senate. Additionally, state and local pay-to-play rules may also restrict political contributions from entities conducting business with specific state and local agencies, as well as those entities’ employees. With respect to Governor DeSantis, Florida’s pay-to-play laws regulating persons who conduct business with the Florida Housing Finance Corporation (FHFC) and Division of Bond Finance appear to only limit contributions to candidates for governor.  However, we have been informally advised that the FHFC is currently reviewing the issue. Investment advisers and others contracting for government services should review political contributions compliance procedures to mitigate the risk of violations of SEC Rule 206(4)-5, MSRB Rule G-37, or any of the numerous state and local pay-to-play laws.  The Akin Political Law team will continue to monitor developments to keep clients informed on this and other key issues.  We are available to develop and implement compliance programs, conduct due diligence and pre-clear contributions for businesses covered by federal, state and local pay-to-play rules.",Akin,Top,No,1.413821819796544,99.63514920379058,98.9060948094224,25.17215731810301,74.89090830090069,61.60101181846282,pay laws,{},"{'race': 'presidential', 'governor': 'sitting', 'laws': 'numerous', 'office': 'federal', 'limits': 'lower', 'candidates': 'presidential', 'rules': 'federal', 'campaign': 'presidential', 'measures': 'necessitate', 'contribution': 'excessive', 'employee': 'covered', 'business': 'certain', 'services': 'advisory', 'associate': 'covered', 'officials': 'covered', 'years': 'prior', 'associates': 'covered', 'partners': 'general', 'members': 'managing', 'officers': 'executive', 'employees': 'such', 'authority': 'such', 'securities': 'municipal', 'entity': 'municipal', 'representatives': 'municipal', 'solicitors': 'municipal', 'principals': 'municipal', 'principal': 'municipal', 'contributions': 'clear', 'categories': 'same', 'individuals': 'covered', 'individual': 'covered', 'amount': 'applicable', 'regulators': 'federal', 'candidate': 'presidential', 'challenges': 'same', 'obstacles': 'similar', 'state': 'certain', 'agencies': 'specific', 'issues': 'key', 'diligence': 'due'}",1,0

Good times.The first-ever, about-damn-time indictment of a felonious former president on federal charges comes via a previously unrevealed federal grand jury impaneled in Florida last month to consider charges stemming from the Slobfather's hoarding of top-secret documents at Hell-a-Lago, and his hissy-fit refusal to return them. The indictment remains under seal, but will likely become public when he's arraigned Tuesday = perp walk alert! - at federal court in Miami. Last week, federal prosecutors had formally told his lawyers he was the target of a criminal investigation, but rumors that the head of DOJ's counter-espionage department was involved spiced up the wait. So did word that prosecutors had made a cunning, preemptive end run around Trump's famous I-declassified-things-in-my-head possible defense by not using the term ""classified information"" to ensure he could still face ten years in prison. Did we mention good times around here?

It's apparently all a rude surprise for the idiot narcissist who's been surrounded by minions giving him ""too much happy talk for way too long"" about what was coming down the righteous pike, or not. Yup: times good.Also, Mark Meadows may (or may not) have flipped and pleaded guilty to lesser charges for limited immunity, which could be disastrous for a guy already on a rapid downward spiral.

358,Christie,2023-06-27,"""Pining For How Simple Life Was When Jesus Ruled and Mom Served Candy For Dinner""","Swaddled in sanctimony, bigotry and mawkish nostalgia for a time in America when white men ran everything, right-wing evangelical fabulists gathered this weekend at a Faith and Freedom confab to celebrate the ""privilege twins"" of Christian nationalism and white supremacy, the triumphant revoking of women's bodily autonomy, and their tawdry Jesus stand-in and cult leader, affirming, per Kari Lake, ""With God on our side, nothing can stop us from taking back this country."" Good God, save us. The ""nation's premier pro-faith, pro-family event,"" the Faith & Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference was held over three fire-and-brimstone-and-bunkum days at the Washington Hilton. Coalition founder Ralph Reed opened the General Session by proudly noting that, thanks to SCOTUS hacks' junk jurisprudence, ""Roe v. Wade (is) in the ash heap of history where it belongs."" Reed also briefly addressed accusations the group has become ""a cult of personality around the former president."" Not so, he insisted: ""The truth (is) we are a cult of only one personality, (and) that is Jesus Christ of Nazareth who is our Lord and savior” - a reassuring message, indeed, to the rest of us godless heathens. Attendees wore ""Walk With Jesus"" caps, declared ""We do not co-parent with the government"" and ""Family is the greatest weapon known to mankind against tyranny,"" flocked to a book signing with Judge Jeanine, applauded godly wingnut Mike Huckabee for winning the Winston Churchill Lifetime Achievement Award, and attended an earlier anti-abortion rally at the Lincoln Memorial where Mike Pence decreed, “Save the babies, and we will save America."" We may have the principled, eloquent Schiff, Raskin, Sanders, AOC et al, but the predicants of Faith and Freedom summoned an impressive army of over 50 speakers, including almost a dozen GOP presidential candidates and the august likes of Hawley, Haley, Lake, D'Souza, Trey Gowdy, Ben Carson, Kayleigh McEnany, Tim Tebow, Oliver North, ""America's comic"" Brad Stine, the founder of Auntie Anne's Pretzels, Former Army officer Steve Russell, who wrote a book about the capture of Saddam Hussein titled ""We Got Him!"" and many other notables. ""It is so good to be in a room with happy, warrior, freedom fighters,” said Sen.Marcia Blackburn of the crowd. ""To those who believe there is no role for the unborn in Washington: You are wrong,” said Lindsey Graham. “We will restore sanity to this nation,"" said Ron DeSantis. ""This is a time to proudly put on the full armor of God."" In other words, notes Noah Berlatsky, it's time to reaffirm white Christian hegemony ""as righteous and natural,"" and Christians as a cultural group ""defined, not by belief or ethics of virtue, but by power."" ""The core truth of white Christianity is not the word of Jesus,"" he writes. ""It's that they believe, first and foremost, that they should rule."" Aptly if insanely, little wonder the event's keynote speaker was a twice-impeached, twice-divorced, multi-indicted, lying, babbling, philandering, Biblically illiterate, legally-liable- for-sexual-abuse, shameless, bonkers former ""president"" who's declaimed ""we have to bring religion back into our country"" though he doesn't even know how to hold a Bible, professed ""no president has ever fought for Christians as hard as I have"" though there's zero evidence except his vile appointment of enough SCOTUS zealots to obliterate women's right to choose, and laughably painted himself as a Christ-like victim whose enemies are God's as well. “I’m being indicted for you,” he told the devout crowd, calling each charge ""a badge of honor."" ""Together, we’re warriors in a righteous crusade to stop the arsonists, the atheists, globalists and Marxists."" In a 90-minute rant, he also vowed to ""keep foreign Christian-hating Communists (and Socialists) out of America."" Wild cheers for doing God's work. ""Our allegiance is to our country and our Creator,"" said Trump, who momentarily forgot Her name but did once try to fuck her. The stunningly bizarre alliance of the Christian right with an altogether loathsome human being, who's somehow often portrayed as crucial to God's redeeming of a sinful world, is at its core a soulless ""study in political opportunism,"" especially given an upcoming GOP presidential race where support from ""born-again pews and pulpits"" is considered a critical, if deeply dispiriting, factor. In a newly emboldened white Christian nationalist landscape - cue Lauren Boebert whining she’s ""tired of this separation of church and state junk"" - even the fringe, QAnon-themed ReAwaken America circus is moving into mainstream politics with a newly created Pastors For Trump, which plans to stump in swing states. At the Faith and Freedom synod, the surreal fact ""Trump is still king of the evangelical cattle call"" was questioned only by Chris Christie, who called out as ""a failure of leadership” a leader ""who never makes mistakes, who says that if something goes wrong, it’s everybody else’s fault, (but) when things go right, everything is to his credit...Our faith teaches us that people have to take responsibility for what they do."" He was met by thunderous boos.Reality, in short, is not the modern GOP's strong suit. Last week, fellow GOP cranks Marjie Greene and Elise Stefanik moved to expunge history itself with a resolution to disappear Trump's two impeachments for colluding with Russia and trying to overthrow democracy as a ""sham smear"" against Trump's ""good name,"" also Hunter Biden. Then the right started blaming ""wokeness"" for the Oceangate submersible disaster; they didn't even register the drowning deaths of 500 migrants enough to make up wacko stories about it, though the Onion - ""Coast Guard Sends Another Submersible Full of Billionaires After the First One"" - was on it, as were wise guys on Melon Husk's Twitter offering $250,000 sun exploration tours on a modified beeswax Cessna called The Icarus. Then Nikki Haley, who at the Faith/Freedom gig lauded an America ""strong and proud, not weak and woke,"" began wistfully reminiscing about an earlier, shining, no pain/ grief/ racism/ incest/suicide, imaginary America: ""Do you remember when you were growing up?"" she mused. ""Do you remember how simple life was, how easy it felt? It was about faith, family, and country. We can have that again, but to do that, we must vote Joe Biden out.""What the ever-loving fuck, said Americans who recalled what was going on around the time Haley was growing up in an apparent rose-colored bubble in South Carolina in the 1970s. The bitter end of a savage Vietnam War that killed millions of innocents, sparked bitter protests at home, gave rise to searing images like Nick Ut's heart-rending, history-changing photo of ""unspeakable evil"" - Kim Phúc, 9, screaming and running in terror from a napalm attack on her village of Trang Bang, her clothes burned off her. Cops and dogs viciously attacking black people - John Lewis was beaten to within an inch of his life - for seeking equal rights under the law. The grief, riots, devastation that followed the assassinations of Malcolm X, JFK, RFK, Martin Luther King. Kent State, Watergate, the '68 Democratic Convention, a country broken and bitterly divided. The president was a crook, marital rape was legal, colored drinking fountains endured, black people struggled to vote, a mob of 200 white supremacists in South Carolina attacked a school-bus filled with dozens of black children as scores of police stood and did nothing. Haley's tweet is ""a masterpiece of magical thinking"" from a woman who ""sees what she wants to see."" It exemplifies a party of magical thinking, of denial and obfuscation and revisionist history, of maudlin, self-serving glorification of a deeply unjust and often brutal past - Happy Days. Back to the (White) Future - in which white men held the power, and held tightly. When was America great, and for whom? Not for blacks, Jews, queers, women, immigrants, Muslims, Asians, brown or poor or Native or disabled or left-handed or left-thinking or in any way divergent people. The deliberate mischaracterizing of past or present - Trump's vision of American carnage, of marauding Mexican rapists, Marxist groomers and black trans vegan feminazis forcing children to read books about slavery and have gay sex - is a much-noted hallmark of fascism. A fictional (better) past was ruined by (inferior) ""others"" who must be blamed and put in their (powerless) place under a white, strict, theocratic, all-encompassing moral code. ""If you win, you need not have to explain,"" wrote Hitler. ""The victor will never be asked if he told the truth."" Nikki Haley, like the rest of her execrable party, likes to say it's time to ""tell the truth."" After her pathetic call back to ""how simple life was"" in a dreamy ""faith, family, and country"" America that only existed for a very few, many others brought some hard truth, like John Cleese on the parrot supposedly resting, stunned, or pining for the fjords: ""It has ceased to be - this is a late parrot."" ""Maybe you were not paying attention?"" suggested one. Another, ""Things seemed simpler when you were a child because you were a literal child."" Ted Lieu remembered ""when folks called me Chink. Threw eggs at our house. Slashed our tires. Called the police because they thought (we) were stealing wild ducks for food. And no one in government looked like me or you."" Jeff Sharlet recalled ""Nixon, Vietnam, every kid in my class terrified of nuclear annihilation, getting beat up for being a Jew."" Mrs. Betty Bowers said it best. ""Do you remember how simple life was, how easy it felt?"" she wrote. ""The sky was always blue. There were no winters or toothaches. Mom served us candy for dinner. Everyone got puppies. We can have that again, but we must first elect an angry fascist."" Badly burned Kim Phuc and other terrified Vietnamese children run from a napalm attack in1972, when Nikki Haley recalls ""how simple life was.""

The Secretary of Transportation can direct the Maritime Administration to apply draft guidelines released earlier this year to six deepwater port applications off the coast of Texas and Louisiana — GulfLink, Blue Marlin, Bluewater, New Fortress Energy Louisiana FLNG, West Delta LNG, and Grand Isle LNG. “If the Department of Transportation approves another mega-polluting offshore export terminal, it will push the world closer to climate catastrophe,” said Kelsey Crane, Senior Policy Advocate at Earthworks. “This administration’s continued expansion of fossil fuels contradicts the promises Biden made to all of us when he said he would tackle the climate crisis.”Building and investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure like offshore terminals locks in decades of new sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The federal government approved Sea Port Oil Terminal (SPOT) last year, the largest oil export terminal in the U.S that will have the capacity of a quarter of all the oil the U.S. currently exports each day. Combined, the four proposed oil terminals would emit three times what the U.S. emits each year.“Coastal communities in Texas are already worried about our poor public health and hurricanes, yet this administration is pushing to increase these risks,” said Melanie Oldham, Founder and Director of Better Brazoria. “We have shown adamant opposition to more export terminals but no one is listening. Biden and his agencies must address our concerns about air pollution and the effects of greenhouse gasses before it's too late.”Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that building new fossil fuel infrastructure would make it more difficult to limit warming to 1.5 degrees celsius, and would lock-in high GHG emissions for decades. If the Biden administration goes forward with these six projects, not only would it derail the country’s climate goals, but ensure that the rest of the world suffers the same fate. “Amidst the challenges posed by rising sea levels and increasingly severe storms, the approval of new offshore oil and gas export terminals compounds our climate crisis and significantly affects communities,” said James Hiatt, Director of For a Better Bayou. “It is crucial for agencies like DOT and MARAD to adhere to CEQ's GHG guidance, meaningfully evaluating greenhouse gas emissions during their reviews. These terminals would contribute massive releases of these harmful gases, and are completely incompatible with our collective best interests.”“The Department of Transportation must carefully evaluate the impact that offshore oil and LNG terminals have on the Gulf Coast and on the climate as a whole,” said Roishetta Sibley Ozane, Founder of Vessel Project of Louisiana. “We cannot overlook these consequences in the face of the climate crisis. It is time to prioritize the long-term well-being of our environment and communities over short-term gains. Our children’s future depends on it.” For additional quotes from letter signers, click here.",Common Dreams,Business,No,2.4044863825720366,97.79425181417338,99.59261725829268,56.9013252912349,75.59086164337931,81.85197036383842,dot climate,{},"{'oil': 'offshore', 'gas': 'liquefied', 'practices': 'best', 'agencies': 'federal', 'applications': 'deepwater', 'terminal': 'largest', 'expansion': 'continued', 'fuels': 'fossil', 'infrastructure': 'new', 'terminals': 'offshore', 'sources': 'new', 'government': 'federal', 'year': 'last', 'health': 'public', 'opposition': 'adamant', 'emissions': 'high', 'fate': 'same', 'levels': 'rising', 'storms': 'severe', 'releases': 'massive', 'gases': 'harmful', 'interests': 'best', 'term': 'short', 'quotes': 'additional'}",1,0
676,Christie,2023-07-31,"""EPA Petitioned to Update 47-Year-Old Toxic Pollutant List""","Conservation groups submitted a formal legal petition today urging the Environmental Protection Agency to add more than 1,000 industrial and commercial pollutants to its outdated list of toxic pollutants requiring regulation under the Clean Water Act. No pollutants have been added to the list in 47 years.The petition, from Northwest Environmental Advocates and the Center for Biological Diversity, addresses numerous categories of toxic pollutants the EPA has failed to oversee that are linked to cancer and other serious health and environmental concerns. Those include “forever chemicals” like PFAS; personal-care products that cause intersex fish; persistent bioaccumulative toxics used as flame retardants; a chemical in vehicle tires known to kill endangered coho salmon; and pesticides commonly used in industrial agriculture.“For nearly 50 years, EPA has been ignoring the growing mountain of science about the more than 1,000 unregulated toxic chemicals contaminating our rivers and drinking water, at a tremendous cost to human health and the environment,” said Nina Bell, executive director at Northwest Environmental Advocates. “The American people count on EPA to keep our drinking water clean, remedy environmental injustice, and protect fish and marine mammals from toxic pollution, but the agency has betrayed that public trust. EPA needs to grant our petition and launch itself firmly into the science of the 21st century.”The EPA acknowledges its list of toxic pollutants is outdated, a shortcoming that undermines the agency’s ability to restrict industrial and municipal discharges of pollutants into waterways. The Clean Water Act requires the EPA and states to take specific steps to prevent or limit listed pollutants from entering waters. Those actions include multiple requirements to reduce discharges of toxic pollutants.The petition cites over 300 scientific reports documenting the adverse effects of unregulated toxic pollutants and their prevalence in waterways.The original toxic pollutant list was created as the result of litigation in 1976 and subsequently incorporated into the Clean Water Act by Congress in 1977. Congress also instructed the EPA to add chemicals to the list over time.“It’s stupefying that the last time the EPA updated its toxic pollutant list, the 8-track was considered an advanced technology and Gerald Ford was president,” said Hannah Connor, environmental health deputy director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Our world has changed dramatically over the past 50 years, but the EPA’s acting like we’re frozen in the ’70s. The agency has turned its back on the deluge of new, dangerously toxic pollutants that have poisoned our waterways and permeated our lives.”BackgroundAmong notable toxic pollutants the petition urges the EPA to include in an updated toxic pollutant list are: Manganese: Manganese has severe neurological impacts on memory, intellectual development, and motor skills. Manganese pollution from coal mining and other industrial processes is particularly severe in Appalachia and has been detected at extremely high levels in drinking water, especially in low-wealth communities.PFAS “Forever” Chemicals: Despite the EPA’s efforts to prioritize addressing forever chemicals, the agency has failed to properly regulate these chemicals under the Clean Water Act in part because they have never been placed on the toxic pollutant list. These chemicals cause infertility, cancer, reduced immune response and adverse health impacts in children.Nonylphenol: Nonylphenols are widely used in a variety of industrial processes. They are endocrine disruptors and mimic estrogens, causing such severe harm to aquatic life that they have banned in the European Union. Endangered Puget Sound orcas have very high levels of nonylphenol causing harm to their ability to recover. These pollutants are virtually unregulated by the EPA.Atrazine: Despite being banned in more than 35 countries, including the European Union, atrazine remains the second-most used herbicide in the United States. It has been linked to increased risk of cancer and reproductive problems in people and can chemically castrate male frogs at extremely low concentrations, including those allowed in drinking water.",Common Dreams,Business,No,2.4044863825720366,99.94508034123892,99.93911984276896,56.9013252912349,75.59086164337931,81.85197036383842,epa petitioned,{},"{'petition': 'legal', 'pollutants': 'toxic', 'list': 'pollutant', 'categories': 'numerous', 'concerns': 'serious', 'care': 'personal', 'toxics': 'bioaccumulative', 'salmon': 'endangered', 'agriculture': 'industrial', 'mountain': 'growing', 'chemicals': 'toxic', 'cost': 'tremendous', 'health': 'human', 'director': 'executive', 'people': 'american', 'injustice': 'environmental', 'mammals': 'marine', 'pollution': 'manganese', 'trust': 'public', 'century': '21st', 'discharges': 'industrial', 'steps': 'specific', 'requirements': 'multiple', 'reports': 'scientific', 'effects': 'adverse', 'time': 'last', 'technology': 'advanced', 'deputy': 'environmental', 'years': 'past', 'impacts': 'adverse', 'development': 'intellectual', 'processes': 'industrial', 'levels': 'high', 'wealth': 'low', 'response': 'immune', 'estrogens': 'mimic', 'harm': 'causing', 'life': 'aquatic', 'herbicide': 'used', 'risk': 'increased', 'problems': 'reproductive', 'frogs': 'male', 'concentrations': 'low'}",1,0

Referring to DeSantis as “GRD,” it said: “1. Attack Joe Biden and the media 3-5 times. 2. State GRD’s positive vision 2-3 times. 3. Hammer Vivek Ramaswamy in a response. 4. Defend Donald Trump in absentia in response to a Chris Christie attack.”Citing “Roger Ailes’ Orchestra Pit Theory,” the document recommended DeSantis go especially hard on Ramaswamy, who is rising in the polls, with the rather lame, Trump-style insult of “Fake Vivek” or “Vivek the Fake.” Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,No,2.8458042421086143,69.42225356538066,99.8644130722257,71.03592646799305,74.90281191742758,86.67491890553441,desantis camp,{},"{'strategist': 'chief', 'look': 'extensive', 'advice': 'cringeworthy', 'debate': 'presidential', 'week': 'next', 'vision': 'positive', 'insult': 'lame'}",0,1

The documents, first reported by the New York Times, urged DeSantis ""to take a sledgehammer” to Vivek Ramaswamy, the Republican entrepreneur who has slowly been gaining in the polls. Dub the primary opponent ""Fake Vivek"" or ""Vivek the Fake,"" the memo advised. Ramaswamy responded to the report Thursday afternoon, who called it ""another boring, establishment attack from Super PAC-creation 'Robot Ron' who is literally taking lame, pre-programmed attack lines against me for next week’s debate."" https://twitter.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1692202661410750526 The strategy documents indicate that DeSantis' campaign may view Ramaswamy as his biggest threat at the Aug. 23 debate, given that former President Donald Trump is not expected to participate. Ramaswamy, a political newcomer, has recently been closing the gap between him and DeSantis. A RealClearPolitics polling average between July 23-Aug. 15 shows Ramaswamy in third place with 6.7%, about eight points behind DeSantis. That's a 4.3-point increase for Ramaswamy in the last two months, compared to a 5.4-point decrease for DeSantis. And Ramaswamy is polling ahead of former Vice President Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Chris Christie—all of whom had bigger name recognition coming into the race than Ramaswamy. While the debate memo also encouraged DeSantis to defend Trump in absentia from attacks wielded by Christie, Trump has celebrated DeSantis' drop in polls, referencing a recent survey by RMG Research. The polling firm holds a B- rating from FiveThirtyEight. ""It’s over for Ron DeSanctimonious, now in 3rd place. Ramaswamy now in 2nd,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday. ""RMG Research.

Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), who continues plummeting in 2024 presidential primary polls. Some people on Twitter are noticing that he might not be handling the pressure so well. In a video posted by Fox News' Paul Steinhauser, DeSantis seems to barely be able to contain the tension when he’s asked about a recently leaked memo posted online by a company with close links to Never Back Down, a super PAC close to the DeSantis’ campaign.  According to the New York Times, which first reported the memo, Never Back Down “has effectively taken over … [DeSantis’] presidential campaign.” The memo, posted on the website of a close advisor to the super PAC, lays out a strategy for the governor to follow to stand out on the stage, including attacking the surging Vivek Ramaswamy as a “fake” and defending former president Donald Trump, who won’t be on the stage, from an attack by Chris Christie. https://twitter.com/steinhauserNH1/status/1692973204510306561 Steinhauser asked DeSantis first about the idea that the “knives will be out” for him at the Republican primary debate on Wednesday.  DeSantis gave the reporter a pained smile in response. Then, when Steinhauser asked a question about the memo, DeSantis can clearly be seen grinding his teeth as the question is asked. “Hes got Homelander tics now,” commented Twitter user @lib_crusher in a retweet. https://twitter.com/lib_crusher/status/1693347306735632733 Homelander, played by Antony Starr in the Amazon Prime series The Boys, often responds to tension and anxiety by subtly grinding his teeth and blowing air out of his mouth while hearing a ringing sound. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh-F6QzJdrE “Starr clenches his teeth and or blows air into his lower lip and cheek area when homelander is trying to suppress anger or remain calm,” explained u/TlN4C in an r/TheBoys thread discussing the show. “I cannot unsee him as homelander now, thanks,” wrote @Twitter user Joexor. “I will never unsee it now” wrote Twitter user @D_Bowey. “This is creepy how accurate it is” Twitter user @Spoopy0_0 wrote. Twitter user @EliotETC jumped on the comparison by editing in the audio track from the show and zooming in on DeSantis, showing just how agitated and anxious he seems to appear. https://twitter.com/EliotETC/status/1693369246422798532 “I bet that guy's long dark nights of the soul are something else altogether,” commented Twitter user @DismalChips. “Those are the eyes of a man who stares daily into the abyss.” DeSantis’ campaign didn’t respond to a question about whether DeSantis sees a resemblance to the character.

This court-enforced deadline comes as a result of years of tireless advocacy from communities across the country and a corresponding lawsuit filed by Earthjustice on behalf of California Communities Against Toxics, Clean Power Lake County, Rio Grande International Study Center, Sierra Club, and Union of Concerned Scientists. Initially filed in December 2022, the lawsuit challenged EPA’s failure to take legally required action to protect the public from harmful carcinogenic air emissions from ethylene oxide sterilization facilities. “Today’s consent decree signing is a critical step to ensuring that communities across the U.S. get needed protections from ethylene oxide emissions from commercial sterilizers. For years, EPA has promised new regulations to rein in commercial sterilizers’ toxic ethylene oxide emissions,” said Earthjustice Senior Attorney Marvin Brown. “And after years of missing their own deadlines, we sued and secured a judicially enforceable deadline. Now EPA must do its part and ensure that its sterilizer rule protects communities from this cancer-causing pollution.” Ethylene oxide is a colorless, typically odorless, flammable gas used to sterilize medical equipment and in the production of chemicals needed for antifreeze, plastics, detergents, and adhesives. It is one of the most toxic air pollutants EPA regulates. This toxic chemical is a known carcinogen to humans, especially when inhaled. EPA updated ethylene oxide’s toxicity value in 2016 and admits that the chemical is 60 times more toxic than previously estimated. Despite this new assessment, it has taken EPA seven years to propose new standards while countless people and their families were left vulnerable to chronic — sometimes fatal — health impacts of ethylene oxide exposure. Now, the agency must use the best-available science to enact the strongest possible protections to ensure that impacted communities will not continue to be subjected to exposure to this aggressive carcinogen. Quotes from our Clients: “As a result of the collaboration of environmental justice communities and national environmental organizations, today marks a monumental step towards cleaner air,” said Celeste Flores, Clean Power Lake County (IL) steering committee member. “We are one step closer to ensuring that the EPA finalizes the crucial commercial sterilizer rules for EtO. We urge the EPA to act swiftly and pass the strongest regulations for healthy communities.” “EPA must adopt strong, health-protective enforceable limits on ethylene oxide for our nation’s 78 sterilizers and their warehouses that include fenceline monitoring to verify those limits are being met,” stated Jane Williams of California Communities Against Toxics. “Thank goodness that we have groups like Earthjustice to fight for us so that agencies like the EPA do much more to protect communities like ours that face extremely high cancer level risks due to dangerous ethylene oxide emissions from commercial sterilizer companies like Midwest Sterilization,” said Tricia Cortez of Rio Grande International Study Center in Laredo, TX. “We need the EPA to pass the strongest rule possible, as quickly as possible.” “Families across Texas have been forced to grapple with the pervasive health and environmental impacts of ethylene oxide emissions. EPA’s harmful inaction on regulating ethylene oxide has benefitted the profits of the sterilizer industry at the expense of the health and well-being of countless families,” said Neil Carman, Sierra Club’s Lone Star Chapter’s Clean Air Program Director. “Now the clock is ticking for the agency needs to act as swiftly as possible to finalize the strongest possible protections for the environment and public health.”",Common Dreams,Top,No,3.401673349820279,99.68881253048852,93.0267580849806,88.83939391033798,73.98867479033586,81.5199525871314,decade missed,{},"{'updates': 'needed', 'deadline': 'enforceable', 'advocacy': 'tireless', 'lawsuit': 'corresponding', 'action': 'required', 'emissions': 'dangerous', 'step': 'monumental', 'protections': 'possible', 'sterilizers': 'commercial', 'regulations': 'strongest', 'deadlines': 'own', 'pollution': 'causing', 'gas': 'flammable', 'equipment': 'medical', 'pollutants': 'toxic', 'chemical': 'toxic', 'carcinogen': 'aggressive', 'oxide': 'updated', 'assessment': 'new', 'standards': 'new', 'people': 'countless', 'impacts': 'pervasive', 'science': 'available', 'communities': 'healthy', 'justice': 'environmental', 'organizations': 'environmental', 'air': 'cleaner', 'member': 'steering', 'rules': 'commercial', 'limits': 'enforceable', 'level': 'high', 'companies': 'commercial', 'rule': 'possible', 'inaction': 'harmful', 'families': 'countless', 'health': 'public'}",0,0

Powell made no acknowledgement of the warnings voiced by a chorus of experts that continuing to raise rates would needlessly cause a recession and cost millions of Americans their jobs. “The Fed’s interest rate hike strategy has done little to contain the corporate greed epidemic fueling high costs, while it has been very effective at extinguishing consumer demand,” said Liz Zelnick, Director of government watchdog Accountable.US’ Economic Security & Corporate Power program. “If the Fed moves forward with another interest rate hike that puts new cars and houses out of reach for many Americans, it could drive demand down to dangerous territory, tarring the economic gains led by the Biden Administration. History has shown that raising interest rates, especially as aggressively as the Fed has done it, almost always leads to low-wage worker harm. The Fed should pump the brakes on future rate hikes.”",Common Dreams,Top,No,3.401673349820279,98.94890473568984,98.60516263733322,88.83939391033798,73.98867479033586,81.5199525871314,fed chair,{'rates': 'higher'},"{'development': 'welcome', 'tone': 'hawkish', 'rates': 'higher', 'survey': 'new', 'goods': 'manufactured', 'epidemic': 'corporate', 'costs': 'high', 'cars': 'new', 'territory': 'dangerous', 'gains': 'economic', 'wage': 'low', 'hikes': 'future'}",0,0

1269,Christie,2023-08-25,"""Lawsuit Challenges Massive Offshore Lease Sale for Failing to Consider Gulf Communities, Climate""","Gulf community and environmental groups sued the Interior Department today to challenge an offshore oil and gas lease sale that would offer up more than 67 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. The department plans to hold the sale Sept. 27. Lease Sale 261, which the Biden administration canceled in 2021, is the last of three offshore oil and gas lease sales mandated under the Inflation Reduction Act. Lease Sales 258 and 259, held in December 2022 and March 2023, were also revived by the IRA. Those lease sales were challenged in federal court for failing to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act.Today’s lawsuit challenges the upcoming lease sale for violating NEPA because Interior did not consider the health threats to Gulf Coast communities living near oil refineries and other polluting drilling infrastructure. The department also failed to adequately consider the climate harm from this massive new source of fossil fuel production. The lease sale could result in the production of more than 1 billion barrels of oil and 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over the next 50 years, resulting in more than 370 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions.The department agreed to limit the leasing area to reduce the risk of driving the endangered Rice’s whale to extinction. Scientists estimate there may be only 51 Rice’s whales left on Earth.The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the District of Columbia on behalf of Healthy Gulf, Bayou City Waterkeeper, Friends of the Earth, Center for Biological Diversity, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Sierra Club.In September, Interior is expected to release its final proposed five-year program for offshore oil and gas leasing. The plan, which lasts through 2028, could include as many as 11 new offshore lease sales. Holding 11 new fossil fuel auctions would sanction up to 70 years of additional fossil-fuel extraction with the potential to emit up to 3.5 billion tons of carbon pollution.Statements from Earthjustice, its clients and partners:“Once again, the Biden administration has fallen short of the federal law by neglecting to consider the impact of this massive oil sale on Gulf communities and the climate,” said Earthjustice attorney George Torgun. “We’re pleased that Interior excluded habitat for the nearly extinct Gulf of Mexico whale from this lease sale, but it’s equally critical that Interior builds on this step and protects climate and Gulf communities from the harms of leasing.”“Unfortunately, given BOEM’s history of sacrificing the Gulf of Mexico to Big Oil, this lease sale decision comes as no surprise,” said Hallie Templeton, legal director of Friends of the Earth. “Our lawsuit should also come as no surprise, since BOEM continues to rely on the same outdated, broken environmental analysis. If we are going to make a dent in the climate crisis, business as usual must stop. We are going to keep fighting until the Gulf of Mexico is off the table for good.”“As steward of the country’s public lands and waters, Interior has a duty to fully consider the harms offshore leasing can cause, from air pollution to oil spills, and beyond,” said Julia Forgie, attorney for NRDC (the Natural Resources Defense Council). “This vast lease sale — for millions of acres — poses threats to Gulf communities and endangered species while contributing to the climate crisis this region knows far too well. We are holding the agency to its obligation to carefully assess these risks and the climate fallout of this giveaway to Big Oil.”“It’s mind-boggling that in this summer of deadly fossil fuel-driven record heat, fires and flooding the Biden administration couldn’t be bothered to look carefully at the damage this lease sale will cause to people, endangered wildlife and the climate,” said Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Across the country we’re seeing lethal wildfires, boiling ocean temperatures and mass coral die-offs, all caused or exacerbated by a climate unnaturally warmed by fossil fuel emissions. We’ve got to stop letting oil and gas companies make it worse by drilling in our oceans.”“It is time to transition away from fossil fuels,” said Kristen Schlemmer, legal director and waterkeeper for Bayou City Waterkeeper. “Continued development in the Gulf of Mexico creates unfair burdens on communities in Houston and across the Gulf South. Moving forward with Lease Sale 261 means more drilling in the years to come. It means more facilities in our backyards. It means higher rates of cancer and heart and lung diseases, and it means more risks during major storms.”“Selling public lands and waters to Big Polluters is incompatible with achieving the ambitious climate goals the Biden Administration itself has set,” said Devorah Ancel, Sierra Club Environmental Law Program senior attorney. “Fossil fuel extraction is destructive to communities, ecosystems, wildlife, and our climate. The devastating effects of climate change, from heat waves to storms, are particularly harmful to frontline communities, as this summer has shown. Moving forward with this lease sale locks us into extraction for decades to come, right as we should be transitioning to clean energy.”",Common Dreams,Top,No,3.401673349820279,95.68142434075172,99.6886021820214,88.83939391033798,73.98867479033586,81.5199525871314,lawsuit massive,{},"{'groups': 'environmental', 'sale': 'vast', 'sales': 'new', 'court': 'federal', 'infrastructure': 'polluting', 'source': 'new', 'feet': 'cubic', 'gas': 'natural', 'years': 'next', 'program': 'proposed', 'leasing': 'offshore', 'lease': 'offshore', 'auctions': 'new', 'extraction': 'additional', 'fuel': 'fossil', 'law': 'federal', 'director': 'legal', 'analysis': 'environmental', 'lands': 'public', 'species': 'endangered', 'heat': 'driven', 'wildlife': 'endangered', 'wildfires': 'lethal', 'fuels': 'fossil', 'development': 'continued', 'burdens': 'unfair', 'drilling': 'more', 'facilities': 'more', 'rates': 'higher', 'risks': 'more', 'storms': 'major', 'goals': 'ambitious', 'attorney': 'senior', 'effects': 'devastating'}",0,0
1270,Christie,2023-08-25,"""In a Summer of Climate Chaos, Fed Summit Ignores Risk of Climate Crisis to Global Economy""","Today, over 70 international, national and state/local organizations released an open letter to the Federal Reserve and central bankers attending this year’s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. The letter calls on symposium participants to act quickly and vigorously to address recent escalations in climate-related financial risks. In remarks this morning, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell omitted any mention of climate-related financial risks in his Jackson Hole speech. The open letter notes that climate change impacts are outpacing authorities’ current efforts to address climate change financial risks. This is evidenced by escalating costs of physical risks and growing gaps in insurance coverage, among other things. Policy makers, especially in the banking and insurance sectors, must: Adopt a precautionary approach to risk mitigation, given climate change’s tipping points and unpredictable tail risks. This could include capital adjustments and other mechanisms to properly reflect the risk of fossil fuel production and thus facilitate a transition;Design capital buffers that specifically take into account the systemic risks of climate change;Require the use of forward-looking tools, such as transition plans, which can help both authorities and market participants better understand and mitigate their own climate-related transition risks, as well as improve understanding of aggregated, systemic risks and promote accountability. Elizabeth Jacobs, a Sustainable Finance Specialist at E3G said: “Jackson Hole is a unique setting, and not only for its natural beauty. At the 2005 Jackson Hole Symposium, warnings about risks building up in the financial system were minimized. Within the next 5 years, the Global Financial Crisis ensued, and policy makers were promptly consumed with giving themselves new authorities designed to avert future crises. Using precautionary approaches and transition plans can help avoid a ruinous rinse, wash, repeat cycle.”Alex Martin, Climate Finance Policy Director at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund said: “Financial regulators have put in increasing effort in recent years to try to understand and better manage climate risk, but unfortunately, climate change is vastly outpacing their progress. Precious little time remains to get ahead of the risk as insurers flee vulnerable areas and banks respond in kind. Resigning ourselves to merely picking up the pieces after climate-driven financial disruptions and crises unfold—which is where we are headed—is utterly unacceptable. Regulators must double down now.""David Arkush, director of Public Citizen’s Climate Program, said: “It is shocking that this symposium, which purports to address structural shifts in the global economy, does not include a single agenda item on the climate crisis or climate solutions — some of the most important drivers of change in the global economy and most significant sources of risk to global financial stability. Rather than stand by as the next global financial crisis develops, the top officials and economists at this conference should be actively considering responses and solutions. And the officials should adopt assertive policies that shepherd the economy and financial system swiftly and safely through the tumultuous climate-related transitions that are already underway.”Jackie Fielder, co-director of Stop the Money Pipeline coalition said: “Any symposium entitled ‘Structural Shifts in the Global Economy’ without a single mention of climate disasters and the billions they have cost everyday people and local economies, should concern every American with a pension who agrees that climate change is here.”Akiksha Chatterji, lead campaigner at Positive Money US said: ""Regulators are failing to act at the scale or pace necessary to curb the significant financial stability threats arising from climate change and fossil fuel financing. Rest assured, climate risks will materialise and we simply cannot quantify the precise nature and timing of these impacts as they are complex and ever changing. Emergency measures taken after a climate-driven financial crash may not suffice to contain such a meltdown. It’s time for the regulators and officials at this symposium to adopt a precautionary approach to climate and do their jobs before another financial crisis ensues.""",Common Dreams,Top,No,3.401673349820279,50.698335168575234,90.9370855604228,88.83939391033798,73.98867479033586,81.5199525871314,climate summer,{},"{'organizations': 'international', 'letter': 'open', 'bankers': 'central', 'escalations': 'recent', 'risks': 'systemic', 'efforts': 'current', 'gaps': 'growing', 'things': 'other', 'approach': 'precautionary', 'mechanisms': 'other', 'buffers': 'transition;design', 'tools': 'looking', 'setting': 'unique', 'beauty': 'natural', 'system': 'financial', 'years': 'recent', 'authorities': 'new', 'crises': 'future', 'approaches': 'precautionary', 'rinse': 'ruinous', 'regulators': 'financial', 'effort': 'increasing', 'time': 'little', 'areas': 'vulnerable', 'disruptions': 'financial', 'shifts': 'structural', 'economy': 'global', 'item': 'single', 'drivers': 'important', 'sources': 'significant', 'stability': 'financial', 'crisis': 'financial', 'officials': 'top', 'policies': 'assertive', 'transitions': 'related', 'mention': 'single', 'people': 'everyday', 'economies': 'local', 'pace': 'necessary', 'threats': 'significant', 'nature': 'precise', 'crash': 'financial'}",0,0
