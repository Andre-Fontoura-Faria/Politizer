Rifles for Two-Year-Olds! Defend Against Radical Lunatics! - to champion their sacred right to add to our bloody carnage. Among a swarm of GOP pols, the Orange Nazi memorably decried yuge gangs of ""communist maniacs"" attacking ""apartment stores"" and carting off refrigerators, air conditioners, ""fur coats, not fur coats, everything."" No wonder they wanna vote for him.The weekend's three-day NRA convention, held in Indianapolis, featured the usual delights: National Prayer Breakfast, Youth Day, much merch - I Am the NRA t-shirts, Don't Tread On Me mugs, NRA: I Am Freedom stickers - and acres of exhibits: Humvees, AR-15 Build Kits ($299), shiny new guns like Colt's bolt-action TacHunter, mini-compact handguns, aluminum M1911-style handguns with 11-round flush-fit magazine capacity, 2023's Gun of the Year Springfield Armory SA-35 9mm with NRA Grips. Because, for retailers, ""NRA members are your best customers! Can you afford to not be here?"" Distressingly, there were also many, many, sweet Jesus too many small children wistfully fingering large guns. Outside the convention, protesters took turns reading the names of the roughly 1,600 American kids killed by guns last year. Organizer Mary Tuttle noted that Indiana lawmakers just passed a bill banning gender-affirming care for minors but declined to act on gun violence, though, ""Zero children have died from puberty blockers. Not one."" Given that, in part thanks to NRA lobbying, Americans have stockpiled over 400 million guns - more weaponry than the Armed Forces, Dept. of Homeland Security, and local police agencies combined - attendees were also greeted by a billboard by Mad Dog PAC reading, ""The NRA Is A Terrorist Organization.""The convention, its stage emblazoned with ""Defend Your Freedom,"" came days after mass shootings at a Nashville school and a Louisville bank, and on the second anniversary of a mass shooting at an Indianapolis FedEx that killed nine people; last year's ever-fearless NRA held their convention days after the school massacre in Uvalde, Texas. Thoughts and prayers all around; the show must go on. Still, NRA organizers boasted the convention was ""the safest place in the USA to be today"" because - WTF - guns were banned as too dangerous. Thus did GOP Presidential hopefuls comfortably, dutifully assemble to kiss the blood-spattered ring of beleaguered NRA CEO, ghoul and thug Wayne LaPierre, who warned, “Gun-hating politicians should never go to bed unafraid of what this association, and all of our millions of members, can do to their political careers."" Some pols phoned it in: Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Ron DeathSantis, who fresh from his pudding bragged that, even after the slaughter of 17 innocents at Parkland, he's ""resisted calls to take up gun control even when such a stand is superficially unpopular,” as though Floridians are only superficially opposed to being gunned down in America's usual killing fields - schools, malls, synagogues, grocery stores etc. He also ran an ad trashing Trump for evidently once suggesting - horrors - maybe the killing should stop.In person, a long list of mostly unknown speakers echoed him; those with higher profiles battled to go ever lower. Asa Hutchinson warned ""Joe Biden and the gun-control extremists (to) give up your pipe-dreams of gun compensation in this free society. Stop endangering our lives with gun bans and stop tramping on the rights of the American people every time tragedy happens."" Vivek Ramaswamy called for more firepower and less CRT in schools, and shutting down the FBI/ATF: ""What does the AR-15 stand for? It stands for freedom."" New Hampshire's Chris Sununu mocked Biden, bragged he vetoed a gun law - cheers - and told the feds to ""shove it."" Mike Pence got booed in his own state - ""I love you too"" - urged more armed guards, sent prayers to the latest dead kids. South Dakota's newly big-lipped, hair-extensioned Gov. Kristi Noem won cheers when she declared ""I am the NRA"" to prove it's not just old white guys - cameraman pans to audience of old white guys; ominously intoned, ""Liberals and Joe Biden want our guns because it will make it easier for them to infringe on all our other rights""; proposed after massacres, ""families gathered together (and) prayed for wisdom and discernment on how to heal hearts and minds""; and eerily boasted her 2-year-old granddaughter ""already owns a shotgun and rifle and soon will need them."" (Twitter: ""And my dog has three books and a calculator."")But Trump, “the most pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment president,” took the gun-nuttery cake, vowing, “I will be your loyal friend and fearless champion,"" like during ""the China virus"" when ""I proudly designated gun dealers as critical infrastructure."" Before the Die-Hard revenge fantasies, he made bombastic claims about his ""epic struggle"" against Dems who ""want to take away your guns while throwing open jailhouse doors and releasing bloodthirsty criminals...to abolish your borders and impoverish your families...to demonize patriots and persecute Christians while pushing the transgender cult.” Whew.

Big, little, everything. Fur coats, not fur coats, everything...They empty out the stores."" And then the police are ""standing there, they're shaking, they want to do their job, but they're not allowed to do their job because of these radical lunatics,"" even though they won't admit most violent crime is ""committed by a brutal class of hardened repeat criminals.

Also, tents in D.C. - ""I had to take them down immediately"" - and ""incredible monuments"" and ""beautiful lawns"" and ""the only one they want to prosecute is Donald Trump, let's get him, it's unbelievable."" Yes. It is. This evil, inept, barking mad clown - who says our mass slaughter ""is not a gun problem"" but a spiritual problem maybe abetted by ""genetically engineered cannabis"" - is the leading GOP candidate for president. Twitter had thoughts: ""Seems totally real. In fact, many people strongly say they see people running with 300-lb refrigerators strapped on their backs while wearing fur coats...They don't even put the fridges under their coats like the old days...They're taking gas stoves too just in case...With tears in their eyes?...Never mind the diamonds and tablets - grab that fridge!...They’re taking the refrigerators 'cause there isn’t strong enough water pressure when they flush the toilets on account of the birds being killed by windmills...I have seen peoople, thugs if you will, carrying 1 fish, even 2 fish, I even saw them with a red fish and a blue fish, just lawlessness everywhere...Since I'm anti-fur, I would suggest the looters stick with 'non-fur' coats. Also, Sub Zero is the fridge you want...They grab 16-ton weights, moons, Mjollnir, everything. Sometimes they just pick up the store and run with it!...And they take things that happened, that didn’t happen, we'll take that for $500...And by the way, they’re coming for you: the liberals, the Blacks, the Jews. The drag queens want to steal your children. Have you bought a gun today?"" All the while, in a broken country where many hateful, lost, white, straight men ""stand back and stand by,"" hungry for control - ""Strength. Boots, smashing faces...My rifle is my best friend - without it I am useless"" - the shooting and killing goes on and on. America's most lethal weekend so far this year, Feb. 17 through Feb. 19, saw 10 mass shootings of over 50 victims: Nine children shot at a Georgia gas station, six people killed in a Mississippi town, eleven people shot in Memphis, five people shot in New Orleans, six people shot on a Chicago expressway. This last week has been almost as bloody. Thursday night, 16-year-old Ralph Yarl was shot in the head in Kansas City for knocking on a neighbor's door while black; miraculously, he survived, and prosecutors Monday night charged an 85-year-old white man with first-degree assault and armed criminal action. This weekend, with the NRA's obscenity underway, 38 people were shot, eight fatally, in gun violence across Chicago. Also this weekend, days after the Louisville bank shooting that killed four, a mass shooting at a sweet 16 birthday party in Alabama killed four and injured 32; a shooting at a crowded Chickasaw Park in Louisville left two dead and four injured. On Saturday, Mayor Craig Greenberg responded to the bloodshed with, ""This is not who we are."" Really? Lookit these kids at the NRA fest.

But our ocean won’t be truly protected until offshore drilling stops once and for all. We hope this is the beginning of the end of drilling off California’s coast.”Environmental Defense Center initially filed a lawsuit in 2014 to stop fracking and acidizing in the region after discovering, through a series of Freedom of Information Act requests, that more than 50 permits had been issued by the federal government without any public or environmental review.“The Supreme Court was right to reject the oil industry’s latest attempt to allow fracking and acidizing in our waters with zero meaningful environmental review,” said Maggie Hall, senior attorney at EDC. “The Santa Barbara Channel is one of the most ecologically rich and important regions in the world. As the climate crisis escalates, ending these destructive extraction practices is a matter of survival — not just for the whales, otters and other animals in the Channel, but for all life on earth.”The appeals court decision also forbids the Interior Department from issuing fracking permits until it completes an Endangered Species Act consultation and an Environmental Impact Statement that analyzes “the environmental impacts of extensive offshore fracking” and “fully and fairly evaluate[s] all reasonable alternatives.”The ruling was the result of three separate lawsuits filed by the Center for Biological Diversity and Wishtoyo Foundation, Environmental Defense Center and Santa Barbara Channelkeeper, and the State of California. The lawsuits challenged the federal government’s approval and inadequate environmental review of offshore fracking in the Pacific Ocean.“Protecting the health of the ocean is essential to conserving the ecosystem upon which Chumash people have thrived for more than 10,000 years,” said Mati Waiya, executive director of the Wishtoyo Foundation, a native-led nonprofit dedicated to the protection of Chumash lifeways and the environment. “We celebrate the appellate court’s decision, which by upholding environmental laws, honors the rights of our people and protects our precious, coastal resources.”The American Petroleum Institute, ExxonMobil and DCOR, LLC, which intervened as defendants in the case, asked the Supreme Court to review the 9th Circuit’s decision. The Department of Justice, representing the federal defendant agencies, opposed the petition for review.""Today’s decision affirms the importance of assessing the impacts of offshore fracking on California’s marine wildlife, fisheries, and coastal communities,” said Ted Morton, executive director of Santa Barbara Channelkeeper. “With ever-mounting threats to ocean ecosystems from climate change, it is essential that federal agencies adequately evaluate the risks of oil and gas development on marine resources.""At least 10 chemicals routinely used in offshore fracking could kill or harm a broad variety of marine species, including marine mammals and fish, Center scientists have found.

338,Pence,2023-06-06,"""Pay-To-Play Laws May Complicate Governor DeSantis’ Presidential Fundraising""","Political Law AlertAfter recently signing legislation allowing state officeholders to run for president without resigning from office, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has officially entered the 2024 presidential race. As a sitting governor, DeSantis’ candidacy may implicate federal and state pay-to-play laws, including Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule 206(4)-5, Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) Rule G-37, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) Rule 23.451. Although Governor DeSantis is seeking federal office, his status as a state officeholder means that individuals and entities who engage in business activities covered by these rules may be subject to contribution limits significantly lower than the $3,300 per election limit that individuals may contribute to federal candidates under federal election laws.  Consequently, federal pay-to-play rules will likely present a fundraising challenge for Governor DeSantis’ presidential campaign, and necessitate compliance measures for the donors covered under these rules.  A single excessive contribution to DeSantis’ campaign by a covered employee could jeopardize a company’s ability to transact certain business with the state of Florida. For example, SEC Rule 206(4)-5 prohibits investment advisers from providing investment advisory services for compensation to a state or local government entity if the adviser, or a covered associate of the adviser, has made a political contribution to certain state or local government officials during the prior two years. Covered associates include general partners, managing members, executive officers of an investment adviser, employees who solicit a government entity for the investment adviser, and any persons who supervise such employees. The rule prohibits contributions to candidates for, and incumbents holding, any elective office which has the authority to directly or indirectly influence the hiring of an investment adviser or to appoint a person with such authority. Similarly, MSRB Rule G-37 prohibits brokers and dealers from engaging in municipal securities business with a municipal entity for compensation if the broker, dealer, or a covered associate has made a political contribution to an official with authority over dealer selection. Covered associates include municipal finance representatives, municipal solicitors, municipal finance principals, supervisors of any municipal finance principal, and members of a dealer’s executive or management committee. Also, CFTC Rule 23.451 restricts political contributions from swap dealers or their covered associates to officials responsible for hiring swap dealers to service state or local government clients for compensation. The same categories of associates covered under SEC Rule 206(4)-5 are covered for purposes of the CFTC rule.  Take note that PACs controlled by persons or entities covered under any of these pay-to-play rules are also covered.  The SEC and CFTC rules permit a de minimis contribution of up to $350 per election to covered officials for whom the contributor is entitled to. The MSRB rule allows for a de minimis contribution of up to $250 per election for covered individuals who are entitled to vote for the candidate.  The federal pay-to-play rules permit any covered individual in the country to contribute up to the applicable de minimis amount to presidential candidates.   Violations of applicable pay-to-play rules result in a two-year ban on providing advisory services for compensation to a government client.  Obtaining a refund of an excessive contribution does not absolve a violation, though federal regulators have the discretion to issue a waiver in the event of an excessive contribution.  The waiver process can be long, however, and there is no guarantee a waiver will ultimately be granted.  While limiting contributions to a presidential candidate may seem unusual, these issues frequently arise when state or local officeholders seek federal office. In 2016, covered associates were confronted with the same challenges regarding contributions to the Trump-Pence ticket before Mike Pence resigned as governor of Indiana. Former Governor Chris Christie’s 2016 presidential campaign faced the similar fundraising obstacles. Please note that federal pay-to-play rules also restrict contributions to certain state or local officeholders running for U.S. House or Senate. Additionally, state and local pay-to-play rules may also restrict political contributions from entities conducting business with specific state and local agencies, as well as those entities’ employees. With respect to Governor DeSantis, Florida’s pay-to-play laws regulating persons who conduct business with the Florida Housing Finance Corporation (FHFC) and Division of Bond Finance appear to only limit contributions to candidates for governor.  However, we have been informally advised that the FHFC is currently reviewing the issue. Investment advisers and others contracting for government services should review political contributions compliance procedures to mitigate the risk of violations of SEC Rule 206(4)-5, MSRB Rule G-37, or any of the numerous state and local pay-to-play laws.  The Akin Political Law team will continue to monitor developments to keep clients informed on this and other key issues.  We are available to develop and implement compliance programs, conduct due diligence and pre-clear contributions for businesses covered by federal, state and local pay-to-play rules.",Akin,Top,No,6.454447698479422,99.63427199882172,98.9079595405612,40.788398712401055,73.87968980799539,62.87680996355047,pay laws,{},"{'race': 'presidential', 'governor': 'sitting', 'laws': 'numerous', 'office': 'federal', 'limits': 'lower', 'candidates': 'presidential', 'rules': 'federal', 'campaign': 'presidential', 'measures': 'necessitate', 'contribution': 'excessive', 'employee': 'covered', 'business': 'certain', 'services': 'advisory', 'associate': 'covered', 'officials': 'covered', 'years': 'prior', 'associates': 'covered', 'partners': 'general', 'members': 'managing', 'officers': 'executive', 'employees': 'such', 'authority': 'such', 'securities': 'municipal', 'entity': 'municipal', 'representatives': 'municipal', 'solicitors': 'municipal', 'principals': 'municipal', 'principal': 'municipal', 'contributions': 'clear', 'categories': 'same', 'individuals': 'covered', 'individual': 'covered', 'amount': 'applicable', 'regulators': 'federal', 'candidate': 'presidential', 'challenges': 'same', 'obstacles': 'similar', 'state': 'certain', 'agencies': 'specific', 'issues': 'key', 'diligence': 'due'}",1,0

Thank God, Jack Smith, the Boxes Hoax and just this once the media for the news twice-impeached, once-indicted, sedition-attempting, legally liable for sexual abuse crook, grifter, rancid heap of human garbage and cameo actor in Home Alone 2 Donald Trump has been indicted, this time reportedly on seven federal charges ranging from willful retention of national defense information under the Espionage Act to conspiracy to obstruct justice to making “false statements.” Espionage! Good times.The first-ever, about-damn-time indictment of a felonious former president on federal charges comes via a previously unrevealed federal grand jury impaneled in Florida last month to consider charges stemming from the Slobfather's hoarding of top-secret documents at Hell-a-Lago, and his hissy-fit refusal to return them. The indictment remains under seal, but will likely become public when he's arraigned Tuesday = perp walk alert! - at federal court in Miami. Last week, federal prosecutors had formally told his lawyers he was the target of a criminal investigation, but rumors that the head of DOJ's counter-espionage department was involved spiced up the wait. So did word that prosecutors had made a cunning, preemptive end run around Trump's famous I-declassified-things-in-my-head possible defense by not using the term ""classified information"" to ensure he could still face ten years in prison. Did we mention good times around here? Already facing 34 state counts of falsifying business records in a New York criminal case, a D.C. grand jury looking into January 6, a Georgia grand jury on election fraud, a $10 million defamation case by Jean Carroll, a gazillion lawsuits and the flames of hell licking at his stubby little fingers, the longtime felon reacted to the latest evidence of his tawdry loserdom with his and his family's usual grace, shrieking and raging it's a ""DARK DAY"" for the U.S. and ""I AM AN INNOCENT MAN!” and ""DOJ, FBI, NEW YORK A.G., NEW YORK D.A., ATLANTA D.A. FASCISTS ALL!"" and ""PERFECT Ukraine phone call"" and ""SCAMS & WITCH HUNTS. A TRAVESTY OF JUSTICE &ELECTION INTERFERENCE AT A LEVEL NEVER SEEN BEFORE,"" like always. It's apparently all a rude surprise for the idiot narcissist who's been surrounded by minions giving him ""too much happy talk for way too long"" about what was coming down the righteous pike, or not. Yup: times good.Also, Mark Meadows may (or may not) have flipped and pleaded guilty to lesser charges for limited immunity, which could be disastrous for a guy already on a rapid downward spiral. Steve Bannon, inexplicably free while appealing contempt of Congress convictions, has been subpoenaed by another federal grand jury convened by Jack Smith to probe the 2020 election and Jan. 6. And increasingly bellicose GOP presidential hopefuls hover, from ""tower of unctuousness"" Mike Pence timidly decrying the scumbag who almost got him hung to Chris Christie slamming ""the last throes of a bitter angry man"" whose family's grift is ""breathtaking.""

Wade last year — conservative activists have hoped that the court would repudiate many old precedents they have long disliked. On voting rights, cases such as Allen v. Milligan, which concerns Alabama’s 2022 congressional map, appeared to be potential vehicles for the court to recast the law in a sharply conservative direction. But last week, a closely divided court tempered such hopes, as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh sided with the three liberal justices in that Alabama case, upholding a core precedent on one of the country’s most important civil rights laws, the Voting Rights Act. They deserve to be commended for — at least in this instance — restraining what has become a reckless, activist court.

Now They May Push Out the State’s Top Election Official.""","by Megan O’Matz ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches, a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week. Meagan Wolfe’s tenure as Wisconsin’s election administrator began without controversy. Members of the bipartisan Wisconsin Elections Commission chose her in 2018, and the state Senate unanimously confirmed her appointment. That was before Wisconsin became a hotbed of conspiracy theories that the 2020 election had been stolen from Donald Trump, before election officials across the country saw their lives upended by threats and half-truths. Now Wolfe is eligible for a second term, but her reappointment is far from assured. Republican politicians who helped sow the seeds of doubt about Wisconsin election results could determine her fate and reset election dynamics in a state pivotal to the 2024 presidential race. Her travails show that although election denialism has been rejected in the courts and at the polls across the country, it has not completely faded away. One of the six members of the election commission has already signaled he won’t back Wolfe. That member is Bob Spindell, one of 10 Republicans who in December 2020 met secretly in the Wisconsin Capitol to sign electoral count paperwork purporting to show Trump won the state, when that was not the case. If retained by a majority of the commissioners, Wolfe would have to be confirmed by the state Senate. But the Wisconsin Legislature is dominated by Republicans who buttressed Trump’s false claims about fraud in the 2020 election. The Senate president has in the past called for Wolfe’s resignation after a dispute over how voting was carried out in nursing homes. Some other senators have registered their opposition to reappointing Wolfe, as well. Republicans and Democrats have fought to a power stalemate in Wisconsin in recent months. Voters reelected a Democratic governor in November of last year and this year elected a new Supreme Court justice who tilts the court away from Republican control. A December 2022 report by three election integrity groups looking at voter suppression efforts nationwide concluded that in Wisconsin the threat of election subversion had eased. “The governor, attorney general, and secretary of state, all of whom reject election denialism, were re-elected in the 2022 midterm election,” they wrote. Still, the groups warned, Wisconsin continues to be a state to watch, noting “the legislature now has an election subversion-friendly Republican supermajority in the senate and a majority in the assembly.” “We are in a better place,” attorney Rachel Homer of Protect Democracy said of the national landscape in a recent press conference following an update to that study. “That said, the threat hasn’t passed. It’s just evolved.” There are fears that the state Senate could refuse to reappoint Wolfe and instead engineer the appointment of a staunch partisan or an election denier, tilting oversight of the state’s voting operations. “It could be a huge disruption in our elections in Wisconsin,” said Senate Democratic leader Melissa Agard. “If you have someone who has this pulpit using it to spew disinformation and harmful rhetoric, that is terrible.” As for Wolfe, she mostly only speaks out about election processes and stays out of the political fray. Through a spokesperson, Wolfe declined to comment in response to ProPublica’s questions. In a public statement issued last week, she said she found it “deeply disappointing that a small minority of lawmakers continue to misrepresent my work, the work of the agency, and that of our local election officials, especially since we have spent the last few years thoughtfully providing facts to debunk inaccurate rumors. “Lawmakers,” she continued, “should assess my performance on the facts, not on tired, false claims.” The commission created a page on its web site to address rampant misinformation. Wolfe has maintained the support of many election officials throughout the state. She has been “a great patriot” for not quitting despite the attacks and for being willing to be reappointed, said the executive director of the Milwaukee Election Commission, Claire Woodall-Vogg. “I think she understands the pressure and understands the peril that the state could face if she’s not in that position.” A Honeymoon, Then Trouble The state commission was created in 2016 by Republican state officials unhappy with the independent board of retired judges that then oversaw elections. They created a panel of three Democrats and three Republicans, advised by an administrator with no political ties. The commission provides education, training and support for the state’s roughly 1,900 municipal and county clerks, who in recent years have faced cybersecurity threats, budget woes, shortages of poll workers and other challenges. The commission also handles complaints, ensures the integrity of statewide election results and maintains Wisconsin’s statewide voter registration database. The administrator manages the staff, advises commissioners and carries out their directives. At first the newly established commission had someone else at the helm: Michael Haas, who had served the prior agency, the Government Accountability Board, which had investigated GOP Gov. Scott Walker for campaign finance violations. (The state Supreme Court halted the probe in 2015, finding no laws had been broken.) As a result, Haas did not win state Senate confirmation and stepped down. The six commissioners then unanimously promoted Wolfe, the deputy administrator, to the top post in March 2018. She won unanimous confirmation in May 2019 in the Senate, which then-state Senate majority leader Scott Fitzgerald said looked to her to “restore stability.” “I met with Ms. Wolfe last week and was impressed with her wide breadth of knowledge regarding elections issues,” Fitzgerald, now a U.S. representative, said at the time. “Her experience with security and technology issues, as well as her relationships with municipal clerks all over the state, will serve the commission well.” The bliss did not last. Wisconsin was one of the first states to put on an election following the start of the pandemic in 2020, amid lockdowns, fear and uncertainty. The primary that April was chaotic, with legal fights over whether to even hold the contest. Local officials closed some polling places. There were long lines in Milwaukee, Green Bay and elsewhere. The governor deployed the state National Guard to assist, and mail-in voting soared. Voters masked against COVID-19 line up during Wisconsin’s primary election in Milwaukee on April 7, 2020. (AP Photo/Morry Gash) Later in the year, after it became clear that Trump had lost Wisconsin to Joe Biden in the election the previous November, state Republicans blasted the elections commission for accommodations made during the pandemic, such as the wider use of ballot drop boxes and unmonitored voting in nursing homes. Critics claimed the moves increased the likelihood of fraud and tainted the election. U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, proposed dissolving the commission and transferring its duties to the GOP-controlled Legislature. Talk of that ended with the reelection last year of Democratic Gov. Tony Evers. The Legislature would need his approval to disband the commission. “What’s happened over the last six years, in particular since the Trump years, is there’s been a systematic attempt to undermine the work of the Wisconsin Elections Commission,” said Jay Heck, executive director of Common Cause in Wisconsin. “Because it’s apparently not as responsive in a partisan way to the Republicans as they would like.” Wolfe became a target. Many Republicans accused her of facilitating the awarding of private pandemic-related grants to election clerks that those critics claimed fostered turnout in Democratic areas, though the money was widely distributed. They also criticized Wolfe for allowing the commission to vote in June 2020 to send absentee ballots to nursing homes during the health emergency rather than have special poll workers visit to assist residents and guard against fraud. Republicans discovered that some mentally impaired people in the facilities who were ineligible to vote cast ballots in Nov. 2020, though the numbers were small and not enough to change the election results. Municipal clerks had received only 23 written complaints of alleged voter fraud of any type in the presidential election, the state’s nonpartisan Legislative Audit Bureau found. Wolfe was the target of lawsuits and insults. Michael Gableman, a former state Supreme Court justice and Trump supporter tapped by the Assembly Speaker to lead a 2020 election investigation, mocked her attire: “Black dress, white pearls — I’ve seen the act, I’ve seen the show.” One conservative grassroots group, H.O.T. Government, has been sending out email blasts urging Wolfe’s ouster, referring to her as the “Wolfe of State Street.” Wolfe does have champions, but they are not as vocal as her critics. “I think she’s done an outstanding job with running the Wisconsin Elections Commission here,” said Cindi Gamb, deputy clerk-treasurer of the Village of Kohler. “She’s been very communicative with us clerks.” Gamb is the first vice president of the Wisconsin Municipal Clerks Association, but she said the group’s rules bar it from making endorsements. Dane County Clerk Scott McDonell finds the assaults on the once-obscure bureaucrat troubling. “What has Meagan done to deserve the abuse she's gotten?” he said. “Nothing.” Wolfe did receive the support of 50 election officials nationwide who called her “one of the most highly-skilled election administrators in the country” in a 2021 letter to the Wisconsin Assembly speaker. Wolfe is a past president of the National Association of State Election Directors. And she has had the backing of a bipartisan business group that in February of last year sent a letter of appreciation to her and the commission. “Although the 2020 elections were among the most successful in American history thanks to your efforts, we recognize election administrators nationwide are facing increasing unwarranted threats and harassment. We hereby offer our sincere gratitude and full support,” said the letter from Wisconsin Business Leaders for Democracy. The 22 signers included the president of the Milwaukee Bucks, the former CEO of Harley-Davidson and two top members of the Florsheim shoemaker family. An Undecided Fate Wolfe’s term expires July 1. To avoid a showdown, some legal experts are exploring whether the commission could take no action and just allow Wolfe to continue past June 30, according to the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel. They’ve pointed to the example of Fred Prehn, a dentist appointed to the state Natural Resources Board who refused to leave after his term expired in May 2021, preserving GOP control over the board. The state Supreme Court ruled last year that Prehn had lawfully retained his position, finding that the expiration of a term does not create a vacancy. And because there was no vacancy, the governor could not make a new appointment unless he removed Prehn “for cause.” Prehn ultimately resigned last Dec. 30. That scenario now is unlikely. Commission chair Don Millis, a Republican attorney, told ProPublica Wednesday that “there will be a vote” in the near future to consider the appointment of an administrator. “If someone didn’t think we should have a vote, and we should rely on the Supreme Court decision in the Prehn case, they could move to adjourn,” he said, but added: “I’m not excited about that. To me it would be avoiding our responsibility if we didn’t act.” Millis declined to say if he would back Wolfe but said he feared that if the commission did not take a vote “that would only add fuel to the fire of the conspiracy theories that we get hit with.” He warned, “If we decide no vote is required and Meagan Wolfe keeps her position after July 1, I can guarantee you we’ll be sued and the courts will decide.” Arguing that Wolfe does not have the confidence of Republicans, Spindell said, “I did tell her that I’m not going to vote for her.” He stressed, however, that he thought she was unfairly blamed for long-standing policies set by the commission. In a letter Wednesday to clerks statewide, Wolfe acknowledged that “my role here is at risk” but said she preferred that the Legislature act quickly to confirm someone, even if it isn’t her. Still, she made it clear she considers herself the best choice to serve the commission. “It is a fact that if I am not selected for this role, Wisconsin would have a less experienced administrator at the helm,” she wrote. And she also made clear what she thinks is driving the questions about her future, writing that “enough legislators have fallen prey to false information about my work and the work of this agency that my role here is at risk.” If the commission does vote on Wolfe, Agard said, she expects Wolfe will secure at least one Republican vote, moving her nomination on to the Senate — and what could be a hostile environment. Senate President Chris Kapenga, a Trump loyalist, told the Associated Press this week that “there’s no way” Wolfe will be re-confirmed by the Senate. “I will do everything I can to keep her from being reappointed,” he said. “I would be extremely surprised if she had any votes in the caucus.” In the Senate, the matter could first be considered by the Committee on Shared Revenue, Elections and Consumer Protection — chaired by GOP Sen. Dan Knodl. In the weeks after the 2020 election, Knodl signed on to a letter calling on Vice President Mike Pence to delay certifying the results on Jan. 6. Spindell already is envisioning a future without Wolfe. He said there is talk of conducting a national search for a new administrator, but Millis said there doesn’t appear to be an appetite among the commissioners for this approach. He noted the commission is pressed for time: Come July 1, the state will be only about 16 months away from a presidential election. State law restricts who can be appointed as election administrator. Appointees cannot have been a lobbyist or have served in a partisan state or local office. Nor can they have made a contribution to a candidate for partisan state or local office in the 12 months prior to their employment. If the position is vacant for 45 days, the Joint Committee on Legislative Organization, chaired by Kapenga and GOP Assembly Speaker Robin Vos, can appoint an interim commissioner.

Does the electorate think you're a prematurely elderly, out-of-touch religious zealot? Well, slip into some leather and hop on a motorcycle like former Vice President Mike Pence. Are you an unknown tech bro with presidential ambitions? Show up to a former president's arraignment and make a ham-handed attempt to grab headlines by demanding your rivals sign a pledge to pardon him. But what if you're Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R)? Thanks to Fox News and DeSantis' former status as the chief presidential suck-up, he's a known quantity. As with any candidate, this is both a positive and a negative. It certainly doesn't help matters that DeSantis is campaigning for the presidency with all the grace of a rabid porcupine. Not even the simple act of greeting a baby can make him come across as anything but ChatGPT pretending to converse with the hoi polloi. Assuming he's is not going to win many points on the likeability scale by eating pudding with his fingers (allegedly), inspiring ""pure hatred"" in his staff, and treating members of his own party (including donors) with the warmth of a White Walker, the best play is for DeSantis to do what comes naturally: attack, attack, attack. DeSantis relishes attacking his enemies, both real and imagined. Some might even say it's his kink. Just ask undocumented immigrants, transgender people, pregnant people, Disney, teachers, drag queens, and books. Today, Florida's governor set his sights on California Governor Gavin Newsom (D). DeSantis enjoys going after Newsom and California almost as much as he enjoys firing people. In his speech, DeSantis challenged Newsom to seek the Democratic presidential nomination and accused him of having a ""bizarre"" and ""serious fixation"" on Florida. ""What I would tell him is stop pussyfooting around,"" DeSantis said. ""Are you gonna throw your hat in the ring and challenge [President Joe Biden] ... or are you just gonna sit on the sidelines and chirp?"" https://www.twitter.com/therecount/status/1669382261400035328 (DeSantis was probably mad that Newsom called him a ""small, pathetic man"" for flying migrants to California on Floridian taxpayers' dimes.) Mature observers made points about the unlikelihood of Newsom running against Biden, DeSantis' own yearlong shadow campaign before his official announcement, and the fact that DeSantis' state might be big, but Newsom's is bigger. Less mature observers zeroed in on DeSantis saying the word ""pussy."" No, he was not talking about genitalia. No, he wasn't bragging about grabbing one. And, yes, he properly used the term ""pussyfooting."" There's just something deeply uncomfortable about hearing Governor Pudding Fingers say ""pussy."" https://twitter.com/XLAnimosity/status/1669417127944568851 Maybe it's his track record of policing vaginas. Maybe it's that absence of charm. Either way, DeSantis could do us all a favor and omit ""pussy"" from his stump speeches. For the children.

701,Pence,2023-06-27,"""Pining For How Simple Life Was When Jesus Ruled and Mom Served Candy For Dinner""","Swaddled in sanctimony, bigotry and mawkish nostalgia for a time in America when white men ran everything, right-wing evangelical fabulists gathered this weekend at a Faith and Freedom confab to celebrate the ""privilege twins"" of Christian nationalism and white supremacy, the triumphant revoking of women's bodily autonomy, and their tawdry Jesus stand-in and cult leader, affirming, per Kari Lake, ""With God on our side, nothing can stop us from taking back this country."" Good God, save us. The ""nation's premier pro-faith, pro-family event,"" the Faith & Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference was held over three fire-and-brimstone-and-bunkum days at the Washington Hilton. Coalition founder Ralph Reed opened the General Session by proudly noting that, thanks to SCOTUS hacks' junk jurisprudence, ""Roe v. Wade (is) in the ash heap of history where it belongs."" Reed also briefly addressed accusations the group has become ""a cult of personality around the former president."" Not so, he insisted: ""The truth (is) we are a cult of only one personality, (and) that is Jesus Christ of Nazareth who is our Lord and savior” - a reassuring message, indeed, to the rest of us godless heathens. Attendees wore ""Walk With Jesus"" caps, declared ""We do not co-parent with the government"" and ""Family is the greatest weapon known to mankind against tyranny,"" flocked to a book signing with Judge Jeanine, applauded godly wingnut Mike Huckabee for winning the Winston Churchill Lifetime Achievement Award, and attended an earlier anti-abortion rally at the Lincoln Memorial where Mike Pence decreed, “Save the babies, and we will save America."" We may have the principled, eloquent Schiff, Raskin, Sanders, AOC et al, but the predicants of Faith and Freedom summoned an impressive army of over 50 speakers, including almost a dozen GOP presidential candidates and the august likes of Hawley, Haley, Lake, D'Souza, Trey Gowdy, Ben Carson, Kayleigh McEnany, Tim Tebow, Oliver North, ""America's comic"" Brad Stine, the founder of Auntie Anne's Pretzels, Former Army officer Steve Russell, who wrote a book about the capture of Saddam Hussein titled ""We Got Him!"" and many other notables. ""It is so good to be in a room with happy, warrior, freedom fighters,” said Sen.Marcia Blackburn of the crowd. ""To those who believe there is no role for the unborn in Washington: You are wrong,” said Lindsey Graham. “We will restore sanity to this nation,"" said Ron DeSantis. ""This is a time to proudly put on the full armor of God."" In other words, notes Noah Berlatsky, it's time to reaffirm white Christian hegemony ""as righteous and natural,"" and Christians as a cultural group ""defined, not by belief or ethics of virtue, but by power."" ""The core truth of white Christianity is not the word of Jesus,"" he writes. ""It's that they believe, first and foremost, that they should rule."" Aptly if insanely, little wonder the event's keynote speaker was a twice-impeached, twice-divorced, multi-indicted, lying, babbling, philandering, Biblically illiterate, legally-liable- for-sexual-abuse, shameless, bonkers former ""president"" who's declaimed ""we have to bring religion back into our country"" though he doesn't even know how to hold a Bible, professed ""no president has ever fought for Christians as hard as I have"" though there's zero evidence except his vile appointment of enough SCOTUS zealots to obliterate women's right to choose, and laughably painted himself as a Christ-like victim whose enemies are God's as well. “I’m being indicted for you,” he told the devout crowd, calling each charge ""a badge of honor."" ""Together, we’re warriors in a righteous crusade to stop the arsonists, the atheists, globalists and Marxists."" In a 90-minute rant, he also vowed to ""keep foreign Christian-hating Communists (and Socialists) out of America."" Wild cheers for doing God's work. ""Our allegiance is to our country and our Creator,"" said Trump, who momentarily forgot Her name but did once try to fuck her. The stunningly bizarre alliance of the Christian right with an altogether loathsome human being, who's somehow often portrayed as crucial to God's redeeming of a sinful world, is at its core a soulless ""study in political opportunism,"" especially given an upcoming GOP presidential race where support from ""born-again pews and pulpits"" is considered a critical, if deeply dispiriting, factor. In a newly emboldened white Christian nationalist landscape - cue Lauren Boebert whining she’s ""tired of this separation of church and state junk"" - even the fringe, QAnon-themed ReAwaken America circus is moving into mainstream politics with a newly created Pastors For Trump, which plans to stump in swing states. At the Faith and Freedom synod, the surreal fact ""Trump is still king of the evangelical cattle call"" was questioned only by Chris Christie, who called out as ""a failure of leadership” a leader ""who never makes mistakes, who says that if something goes wrong, it’s everybody else’s fault, (but) when things go right, everything is to his credit...Our faith teaches us that people have to take responsibility for what they do."" He was met by thunderous boos.Reality, in short, is not the modern GOP's strong suit. Last week, fellow GOP cranks Marjie Greene and Elise Stefanik moved to expunge history itself with a resolution to disappear Trump's two impeachments for colluding with Russia and trying to overthrow democracy as a ""sham smear"" against Trump's ""good name,"" also Hunter Biden. Then the right started blaming ""wokeness"" for the Oceangate submersible disaster; they didn't even register the drowning deaths of 500 migrants enough to make up wacko stories about it, though the Onion - ""Coast Guard Sends Another Submersible Full of Billionaires After the First One"" - was on it, as were wise guys on Melon Husk's Twitter offering $250,000 sun exploration tours on a modified beeswax Cessna called The Icarus. Then Nikki Haley, who at the Faith/Freedom gig lauded an America ""strong and proud, not weak and woke,"" began wistfully reminiscing about an earlier, shining, no pain/ grief/ racism/ incest/suicide, imaginary America: ""Do you remember when you were growing up?"" she mused. ""Do you remember how simple life was, how easy it felt? It was about faith, family, and country. We can have that again, but to do that, we must vote Joe Biden out.""What the ever-loving fuck, said Americans who recalled what was going on around the time Haley was growing up in an apparent rose-colored bubble in South Carolina in the 1970s. The bitter end of a savage Vietnam War that killed millions of innocents, sparked bitter protests at home, gave rise to searing images like Nick Ut's heart-rending, history-changing photo of ""unspeakable evil"" - Kim Phúc, 9, screaming and running in terror from a napalm attack on her village of Trang Bang, her clothes burned off her. Cops and dogs viciously attacking black people - John Lewis was beaten to within an inch of his life - for seeking equal rights under the law. The grief, riots, devastation that followed the assassinations of Malcolm X, JFK, RFK, Martin Luther King. Kent State, Watergate, the '68 Democratic Convention, a country broken and bitterly divided. The president was a crook, marital rape was legal, colored drinking fountains endured, black people struggled to vote, a mob of 200 white supremacists in South Carolina attacked a school-bus filled with dozens of black children as scores of police stood and did nothing. Haley's tweet is ""a masterpiece of magical thinking"" from a woman who ""sees what she wants to see."" It exemplifies a party of magical thinking, of denial and obfuscation and revisionist history, of maudlin, self-serving glorification of a deeply unjust and often brutal past - Happy Days. Back to the (White) Future - in which white men held the power, and held tightly. When was America great, and for whom? Not for blacks, Jews, queers, women, immigrants, Muslims, Asians, brown or poor or Native or disabled or left-handed or left-thinking or in any way divergent people. The deliberate mischaracterizing of past or present - Trump's vision of American carnage, of marauding Mexican rapists, Marxist groomers and black trans vegan feminazis forcing children to read books about slavery and have gay sex - is a much-noted hallmark of fascism. A fictional (better) past was ruined by (inferior) ""others"" who must be blamed and put in their (powerless) place under a white, strict, theocratic, all-encompassing moral code. ""If you win, you need not have to explain,"" wrote Hitler. ""The victor will never be asked if he told the truth."" Nikki Haley, like the rest of her execrable party, likes to say it's time to ""tell the truth."" After her pathetic call back to ""how simple life was"" in a dreamy ""faith, family, and country"" America that only existed for a very few, many others brought some hard truth, like John Cleese on the parrot supposedly resting, stunned, or pining for the fjords: ""It has ceased to be - this is a late parrot."" ""Maybe you were not paying attention?"" suggested one. Another, ""Things seemed simpler when you were a child because you were a literal child."" Ted Lieu remembered ""when folks called me Chink. Threw eggs at our house. Slashed our tires. Called the police because they thought (we) were stealing wild ducks for food. And no one in government looked like me or you."" Jeff Sharlet recalled ""Nixon, Vietnam, every kid in my class terrified of nuclear annihilation, getting beat up for being a Jew."" Mrs. Betty Bowers said it best. ""Do you remember how simple life was, how easy it felt?"" she wrote. ""The sky was always blue. There were no winters or toothaches. Mom served us candy for dinner. Everyone got puppies. We can have that again, but we must first elect an angry fascist."" Badly burned Kim Phuc and other terrified Vietnamese children run from a napalm attack in1972, when Nikki Haley recalls ""how simple life was.""

1194,Pence,2023-07-31,"""DOT Should Consider Climate Impacts of Proposed Offshore Export Terminals""","Today 130 organizations are calling on Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to require his agencies to consider the impacts offshore oil and liquefied methane gas (LNG) export terminals will have on the climate when reviewing their applications.The letter comes as the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) finalizes best practices for federal agencies to use when evaluating greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts of projects proposed under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Secretary of Transportation can direct the Maritime Administration to apply draft guidelines released earlier this year to six deepwater port applications off the coast of Texas and Louisiana — GulfLink, Blue Marlin, Bluewater, New Fortress Energy Louisiana FLNG, West Delta LNG, and Grand Isle LNG. “If the Department of Transportation approves another mega-polluting offshore export terminal, it will push the world closer to climate catastrophe,” said Kelsey Crane, Senior Policy Advocate at Earthworks. “This administration’s continued expansion of fossil fuels contradicts the promises Biden made to all of us when he said he would tackle the climate crisis.”Building and investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure like offshore terminals locks in decades of new sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The federal government approved Sea Port Oil Terminal (SPOT) last year, the largest oil export terminal in the U.S that will have the capacity of a quarter of all the oil the U.S. currently exports each day. Combined, the four proposed oil terminals would emit three times what the U.S. emits each year.“Coastal communities in Texas are already worried about our poor public health and hurricanes, yet this administration is pushing to increase these risks,” said Melanie Oldham, Founder and Director of Better Brazoria. “We have shown adamant opposition to more export terminals but no one is listening. Biden and his agencies must address our concerns about air pollution and the effects of greenhouse gasses before it's too late.”Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that building new fossil fuel infrastructure would make it more difficult to limit warming to 1.5 degrees celsius, and would lock-in high GHG emissions for decades. If the Biden administration goes forward with these six projects, not only would it derail the country’s climate goals, but ensure that the rest of the world suffers the same fate. “Amidst the challenges posed by rising sea levels and increasingly severe storms, the approval of new offshore oil and gas export terminals compounds our climate crisis and significantly affects communities,” said James Hiatt, Director of For a Better Bayou. “It is crucial for agencies like DOT and MARAD to adhere to CEQ's GHG guidance, meaningfully evaluating greenhouse gas emissions during their reviews. These terminals would contribute massive releases of these harmful gases, and are completely incompatible with our collective best interests.”“The Department of Transportation must carefully evaluate the impact that offshore oil and LNG terminals have on the Gulf Coast and on the climate as a whole,” said Roishetta Sibley Ozane, Founder of Vessel Project of Louisiana. “We cannot overlook these consequences in the face of the climate crisis. It is time to prioritize the long-term well-being of our environment and communities over short-term gains. Our children’s future depends on it.” For additional quotes from letter signers, click here.",Common Dreams,Business,No,3.9975895706695694,97.7889485688776,99.5932517616146,0.0,79.16898696346436,88.26868767248507,dot climate,{},"{'oil': 'offshore', 'gas': 'liquefied', 'practices': 'best', 'agencies': 'federal', 'applications': 'deepwater', 'terminal': 'largest', 'expansion': 'continued', 'fuels': 'fossil', 'infrastructure': 'new', 'terminals': 'offshore', 'sources': 'new', 'government': 'federal', 'year': 'last', 'health': 'public', 'opposition': 'adamant', 'emissions': 'high', 'fate': 'same', 'levels': 'rising', 'storms': 'severe', 'releases': 'massive', 'gases': 'harmful', 'interests': 'best', 'term': 'short', 'quotes': 'additional'}",0,0
1195,Pence,2023-07-31,"""EPA Petitioned to Update 47-Year-Old Toxic Pollutant List""","Conservation groups submitted a formal legal petition today urging the Environmental Protection Agency to add more than 1,000 industrial and commercial pollutants to its outdated list of toxic pollutants requiring regulation under the Clean Water Act. No pollutants have been added to the list in 47 years.The petition, from Northwest Environmental Advocates and the Center for Biological Diversity, addresses numerous categories of toxic pollutants the EPA has failed to oversee that are linked to cancer and other serious health and environmental concerns. Those include “forever chemicals” like PFAS; personal-care products that cause intersex fish; persistent bioaccumulative toxics used as flame retardants; a chemical in vehicle tires known to kill endangered coho salmon; and pesticides commonly used in industrial agriculture.“For nearly 50 years, EPA has been ignoring the growing mountain of science about the more than 1,000 unregulated toxic chemicals contaminating our rivers and drinking water, at a tremendous cost to human health and the environment,” said Nina Bell, executive director at Northwest Environmental Advocates. “The American people count on EPA to keep our drinking water clean, remedy environmental injustice, and protect fish and marine mammals from toxic pollution, but the agency has betrayed that public trust. EPA needs to grant our petition and launch itself firmly into the science of the 21st century.”The EPA acknowledges its list of toxic pollutants is outdated, a shortcoming that undermines the agency’s ability to restrict industrial and municipal discharges of pollutants into waterways. The Clean Water Act requires the EPA and states to take specific steps to prevent or limit listed pollutants from entering waters. Those actions include multiple requirements to reduce discharges of toxic pollutants.The petition cites over 300 scientific reports documenting the adverse effects of unregulated toxic pollutants and their prevalence in waterways.The original toxic pollutant list was created as the result of litigation in 1976 and subsequently incorporated into the Clean Water Act by Congress in 1977. Congress also instructed the EPA to add chemicals to the list over time.“It’s stupefying that the last time the EPA updated its toxic pollutant list, the 8-track was considered an advanced technology and Gerald Ford was president,” said Hannah Connor, environmental health deputy director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Our world has changed dramatically over the past 50 years, but the EPA’s acting like we’re frozen in the ’70s. The agency has turned its back on the deluge of new, dangerously toxic pollutants that have poisoned our waterways and permeated our lives.”BackgroundAmong notable toxic pollutants the petition urges the EPA to include in an updated toxic pollutant list are: Manganese: Manganese has severe neurological impacts on memory, intellectual development, and motor skills. Manganese pollution from coal mining and other industrial processes is particularly severe in Appalachia and has been detected at extremely high levels in drinking water, especially in low-wealth communities.PFAS “Forever” Chemicals: Despite the EPA’s efforts to prioritize addressing forever chemicals, the agency has failed to properly regulate these chemicals under the Clean Water Act in part because they have never been placed on the toxic pollutant list. These chemicals cause infertility, cancer, reduced immune response and adverse health impacts in children.Nonylphenol: Nonylphenols are widely used in a variety of industrial processes. They are endocrine disruptors and mimic estrogens, causing such severe harm to aquatic life that they have banned in the European Union. Endangered Puget Sound orcas have very high levels of nonylphenol causing harm to their ability to recover. These pollutants are virtually unregulated by the EPA.Atrazine: Despite being banned in more than 35 countries, including the European Union, atrazine remains the second-most used herbicide in the United States. It has been linked to increased risk of cancer and reproductive problems in people and can chemically castrate male frogs at extremely low concentrations, including those allowed in drinking water.",Common Dreams,Business,No,3.9975895706695694,99.9449482987765,99.9391334237616,0.0,79.16898696346436,88.26868767248507,epa petitioned,{},"{'petition': 'legal', 'pollutants': 'toxic', 'list': 'pollutant', 'categories': 'numerous', 'concerns': 'serious', 'care': 'personal', 'toxics': 'bioaccumulative', 'salmon': 'endangered', 'agriculture': 'industrial', 'mountain': 'growing', 'chemicals': 'toxic', 'cost': 'tremendous', 'health': 'human', 'director': 'executive', 'people': 'american', 'injustice': 'environmental', 'mammals': 'marine', 'pollution': 'manganese', 'trust': 'public', 'century': '21st', 'discharges': 'industrial', 'steps': 'specific', 'requirements': 'multiple', 'reports': 'scientific', 'effects': 'adverse', 'time': 'last', 'technology': 'advanced', 'deputy': 'environmental', 'years': 'past', 'impacts': 'adverse', 'development': 'intellectual', 'processes': 'industrial', 'levels': 'high', 'wealth': 'low', 'response': 'immune', 'estrogens': 'mimic', 'harm': 'causing', 'life': 'aquatic', 'herbicide': 'used', 'risk': 'increased', 'problems': 'reproductive', 'frogs': 'male', 'concentrations': 'low'}",0,0

Ron DeSantis (Fla.), betting site PredictIt indicates. Over the weekend, DeSantis dropped below Ramaswamy on the online gambling service for the first time since the two entered the crowded race, which includes former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence.  DeSantis has been in the public eye for years since he took over Florida in 2019 and developed a firebrand personality. Meanwhile, Ramaswamy was relatively unknown when he entered the race and is running an underdog campaign. PredictIt works by having users buy shares in a given candidate’s likelihood of reaching a certain outcome while running for office, somewhat similar to the stock market. For the 2024 presidential nomination, people can invest in any candidate they think will win or lose, even ones who haven’t declared, like Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) Users of PredictIt make bets on candidates by buying shares, the price of which is between one dollar and 99 cents per share. On Friday, Ramaswamy reached 19 cents in favor of a win, which was two cents above where DeSantis stood. Ramaswamy then dropped to 17 cents, just barely above DeSantis’ 16 cents, before returning to the current neck-and-neck price with DeSantis at 15 cents. In the past 90 days, bets on DeSantis have hovered in the high 20s and low 30s. Ramaswamy started at just three cents at the end of last month, but quickly ascended to 14 cents in mid-July, as DeSantis has faltered.  Bets have wanted on DeSantis as he continues to lag behind Trump in a new national poll and is stumping on economic policy in New Hampshire. DeSantis’ campaign has been plagued by controversy lately, and he recently shed a third of his staff. He also recently let go an aide who shared a video that included Nazi symbolism. New Zealand political tech company Aristotle launched Predictit in 2014, and it caught the internet’s attention during the 2016 election, providing insight that some say is better than what’s gleaned from polls, which are more a reflection of where voters stand on a candidate at that point in time, not guessing who might win. PredictIt calls on participants to put their money on how people will vote in the future, while also allowing Americans to participate in legal gambling on elections. But it hasn’t always been on the mark. Jeb Bush was pinned as a favorite by betters on the site months before he eventually dropped out after a poor showing in South Carolina. Shortly before the 2020 presidential race was called, PredictIt showed Biden’s chances of winning at 84 percent.  Meanwhile, Ramaswamy is on a victory lap, celebrating his emergence as a leading candidate. He recently reached the unique donor threshold required to appear at the first GOP debate in August and received a standing ovation when he stopped at the Lincoln Day Dinner in Iowa.

Deep Throat – in real life, the FBI deputy director Mark Felt – is ominous and taciturn, refusing to say all that he knows. “I have to do this my way,” he tells Redford. “You tell me what you know, and I’ll confirm.” But he offers a blunt assessment of the inner workings of the Nixon administration. “Forget the myths that the media has created about the White House,” Deep Throat tells Woodward. “The truth is these are not very bright guys, and things got out of hand.”Few moments in history, including the Watergate scandal, have done so much to puncture the dignified mystique of American government as Donald Trump’s frantic, cynical and preposterous attempts to hang on to power after losing the 2020 election. The indictment against him related that effort, unsealed on Tuesday by the office of special counsel Jack Smith, charges Trump with engaging in three conspiracies: to defraud the United States in seeking to overturn the election, to obstruct the government in seeking to derail the January 6 proceedings, and perhaps most meaningfully, to deprive American voters of their right to have their votes counted.

They must be exposed for the blatant lies they areThe prospect of Donald Trump finally facing justice for the most serious of his many alleged crimes – conspiring to subvert the 2020 US presidential election – is cheering. Unfortunately, it has taken more than two and a half years to call the disgraced former president to account for his actions after his loss to Joe Biden. This delay has enabled Trump and his supporters to link last week’s criminal indictment to the 2024 election campaign. They denounce it as a politically motivated bid to torpedo the Republican frontrunner’s attempted comeback.Like so much of what Trump says, this is a blatant lie – though sadly, many Americans believe it. Biden has scrupulously distanced himself from the multiple investigations into his predecessor’s conduct. For too long, the attorney general, Merrick Garland, whose justice department operates independently of the White House, failed to act – hoping, perhaps, that the Trump-Maga phenomenon would fade.

The founders of the country created the judiciary as the third branch of the federal government to keep executive power in check and prevent corruption. So it was a cause for deep concern last week when Donald Trump unleashed a verbal tantrum on his Truth Social platform, accusing special counsel Jack Smith of “prosecutorial misconduct” even before he filed four federal criminal counts against the former president over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in a bid to remain in office.An identical barrage came last April when a Manhattan grand jury indicted Trump on 34 felony charges for falsifying business records. That time, he also called for defunding the justice department and the FBI, even though the charges did not come from either federal agency. Both reactions were part of a long-running campaign by Trump to undermine the rule of law in the US and dismiss the multiple charges he faces, and has denied, as politically motivated. Even lawyers who once supported Trump have told me that delegitimising the law and the judiciary could destroy the country’s system of government.

They typically open in the air, dispersing multiple bomblets or submunitions over a wide area. Many submunitions fail to explode on initial impact, leaving bomblets that pose a long-lasting danger, like landmines.South Sudan’s National Assembly approved a proposal to accede to the 2008 Convention on Cluster Munitions on May 9. South Sudan deposited the instrument of accession with the United Nations on August 3.The convention comprehensively bans cluster munitions and requires states parties to destroy their stockpiles, clear areas contaminated by cluster munition remnants, and provide assistance to victims of the weapons.South Sudan had expressed interest in joining the convention since it became an independent state on July 9, 2011. The executive Council of Ministers unanimously approved South Sudan’s accession to the convention in 2017 and referred the matter to parliament for legislative approval.South Sudan has participated as an observer at formal meetings of the convention since 2011. It joined the international treaty banning antipersonnel landmines on November 11, 2011, through the process of “succession” after gaining its independence from Sudan.South Sudan provided voluntary transparency reports to the convention in 2020 and 2021, confirming that it does not possess any stocks of cluster munitions. In 2014, South Sudan stated that it has not produced cluster munitions and does not intend to acquire or use them.There have been no reports or allegations of South Sudanese government forces using cluster munitions, but the country is contaminated from air-dropped and ground-launched cluster munition remnants left over from previous conflicts.Human Rights Watch reported in February 2014 that remnants of Soviet-era RBK 250-275 cluster bombs, including intact AO-1SCh submunitions, were found outside the city of Bor in Jonglei state, after airstrikes by Ugandan forces, which were providing air support to the South Sudan government during a military operation against opposition forces. Uganda – a signatory to the convention – denied that it had used cluster munitions.The National Mine Action Authority of South Sudan should step up its efforts to clear cluster munition remnants and to assist victims of the weapons, Human Rights Watch said.In addition to the 112 states that are party to the Convention on Cluster Munitions, which came into force on August 1, 2010, another 12 have signed the convention but not yet ratified it. Nigeria was the previous country to ratify the convention, on February 28, 2023.Eight of the signatory countries that have not ratified the convention are in Africa: Angola, Central African Republic, Democratic Republic of Congo, Djibouti, Kenya, Liberia, Tanzania, and Uganda. The others are Cyprus, Haiti, Indonesia, and Jamaica.Ten other countries in Africa have not joined the convention: Algeria, Egypt, Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Ethiopia, Gabon, Libya, Morocco, Sudan, and Zimbabwe.Since its all-out invasion on February 24, 2022, Russian forces have repeatedly used cluster munitions in Ukraine, causing civilian casualties, damaging civilian infrastructure and contaminating agricultural land. Ukrainian forces have also used cluster munitions, causing civilian deaths and injuries. Cluster munitions were previously used by the Syrian-Russian military alliance in attacks in Idlib governorate in Syria on November 6, 2022, killing and wounding civilians. None of these countries have joined the Convention on Cluster Munitions.“Clearing landmines and explosive remnants of war is a critical way to help many Africans achieve safety and security in their daily lives,” Wareham said. “With this accession we hope that South Sudan receives greater support to continue its clearance and destruction of cluster munition remnants, landmines, and other weapons used in past conflicts.”Human Rights Watch is a co-founder of the Cluster Munition Coalition, the global coalition of nongovernmental organizations working to eradicate cluster munitions and provides editing for its annual Cluster Munition Monitor report.",Common Dreams,Top,No,5.012286093611989,89.33618562714022,99.83954768182276,16.845843022591325,82.85856608142501,82.36893687576823,cluster munitions,{},"{'step': 'important', 'peace': 'international', 'director': 'acting', 'countries': 'other', 'use': 'new', 'rights': 'humanitarian', 'bomblets': 'multiple', 'area': 'wide', 'submunitions': 'intact', 'impact': 'initial', 'danger': 'lasting', 'areas': 'clear', 'state': 'independent', 'approval': 'legislative', 'meetings': 'formal', 'treaty': 'international', 'transparency': 'voluntary', 'forces': 'ukrainian', 'remnants': 'explosive', 'conflicts': 'past', 'operation': 'military', 'country': 'previous', 'invasion': 'out', 'casualties': 'civilian', 'infrastructure': 'civilian', 'land': 'agricultural', 'deaths': 'civilian', 'alliance': 'military', 'way': 'critical', 'lives': 'daily', 'support': 'greater', 'weapons': 'other', 'coalition': 'global', 'organizations': 'nongovernmental', 'report': 'annual'}",1,1

1528,Pence,2023-08-07,"""The Grace of the American Republic: Looking Forward To the Appropriate Catastrophe""","In his latest encounter with reality - SAD! - America's disgraced, lying, multiple-indicted ""perpetual defendant"" was charged in a 4th jurisdiction with a 4th grievous crime of trying to overthrow democracy. Astoundingly, he's still whining and criming: Sack the judge, move the trial, attack the four prosecutors (coincidentally, 3 of them black) doing their jobs. But belated accountability looms. Former Capitol cop Mike Fanone: “Donald Trump spent his entire lifetime fucking around and he’s about to find out."" Having ""shattered the laws of political physics,"" the baby-mobster who always viewed the law as a weapon he could wield against his many supposed enemies now faces 78 criminal charges in both state and federal jurisdictions, with more very likely to come. Last week, Trump became the 1,078th person indicted for federal crimes in connection with the January 6, 2021 storming of the Capitol, marking a record fourth time in just four months he's been accused of committing a serious crime distinct from his other indictable ones - never mind all those, it must be noted, from the decades-long malfeasance he's slithered away from pain-and-shame-and-prison-free. The Jan. 6 indictment, of course, joins an already tawdry list of transgressions: 37 felony charges for stealing and then hiding/lying about classified documents; 34 New York charges for paying hush money to Stormy Daniels; also in New York, charges of massive business fraud that could ban him and his evil spawn from future dealings there plus legal liability for sexual assault; and charges reportedly coming soon in Georgia for pushing to ""find"" 11,780 election votes he didn't get. All told, he's expected to face $40 million in legal bills this year alone; good thing for him, he usually doesn't pay them anyway.On Thursday, observers noted, a wannabe dictator so bloated with insecurity he puts his name on buildings, golf clubs, shirts and even his stupid umbrella was cut down to paltry size with ""exquisite symbolism."" With no family or minions present, he was taken into custody by the government he tried to overthrow in a courthouse between two scenes of the crime - the White House and Capitol. To the cry of ""All rise!"" - no more Hail to the Chief - the lifetime sexist, racist xenophobe faced U.S. District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, a Jamaica-born, Obama-appointed female judge who's handed down some of the harshest sentences to Jan. 6 rioters and who earlier rejected Trump’s attempt to block the Jan. 6 Select Committee from getting access to presidential records with, ""Presidents are not kings, and plaintiff is not president."" And in her reportedly most galling humbling of him, she called him ""Mr. Trump,"" not his favorite, delusional ""President"" - ""a citizen, no more and no less."" He underwent the same mundane legal rituals as any criminal defendant - swearing in, name and age - before hearing the litany of charges, ""term of imprisonment"" (oh please) if convicted, and warning that, “If you fail to comply with any conditions of your release, a warrant may be issued for your arrest” (ditto).The 45-page indictment lists four counts against Trump: Conspiracy to defraud the United States ""by using dishonesty, fraud and deceit"" to obstruct the collecting, counting, and certifying of election results; Conspiracy to Impede Congressional Proceeding on Jan. 6; Conspiracy Against Rights ie: to vote and have that vote counted; Obstruction of Official Proceeding ie: certification of the vote. Undercutting the likely (and actual) ""free speech"" defense argument of Trump attorneys, it pointedly notes he had the right to challenge or even lie about the election, but not to do anything about it, aka ""use unlawful means of discounting legitimate votes and subverting the election results"" - like installing 16 fake GOP electors in Michigan now facing felony charges, or calling Georgia officials to ""find"" votes he didn't get. It also lists six unnamed co-conspirators - Giuliani, Powell, Eastman etc - and spends 15 pages documenting the key fact Trump knew he was lying - one advisor called the claims of fraud ""conspiracy shit beamed down from the mothership"" - but kept doing it anyway. Jan 6. was ""an unprecedented assault on the seat of American democracy"" fueled by lies, charged Jack Smith, who had sat in the front of the courtroom glowering at Trump; now, he urged all Americans to read the indictment ""in full.""Trump has tried to whip up his supporters to go to battle for him; at rallies he's taken to claiming, Christ-like, “They’re not indicting me, they’re indicting you."" But only a small crowd turned up at the arraignment; their signs ranged from ""Ultra Extreme MAGA"" to ""Jail Trump Forever""; and the snarling bully who once led rabid chants of ""Lock Her Up!” now gives prosecutors fresh lethal ammunition every time he opens his vile, clueless mouth. Charlie Pierce at Esquire likened the spectacle to the 1807 trial of Aaron Burr, now ""no longer the only president or vice-president to be indicted for crimes against the nation he once served""; he quotes the prosecutor's taunt to the defense, ""If the gentleman pleases, he is at liberty to consider the whole trial as a piece of epic action, and to look forward to the appropriate catastrophe"" - in this case, an expected hanging of Burr that never took place. In the case of Jack Smith, Pierce argues, the power of his ""monumental"" historical and legal document lies in its precision: Smith has crafted an indictment ""precisely drawn to sit the former president* down under a swinging lightbulb in a dark interrogation room...There is very little room for the defendant to breathe."" If we're lucky, Pierce adds, ""There is thunder in this indictment that will echo for decades."" Many others view this latest charge as a potential turning point in our long, sordid, national calamity, both anguished melodrama and buffoonish farce. In The Atlantic's ""This Is the Case,"" Tom Nichols argues we can ""no longer indulge the pretense that Trump is just another Republican candidate,"" like when ""an annoying uncle rhapsodizes about stolen elections,"" describes opponents as pedophiles or rants about ""the dire national-security implications around Hunter Biden’s genitalia."" Deeming Trump’s candidacies ""moral choices and tests of civic character,"" he avers the new indictment ""challenges every American to put a shoulder to the wheel and defend our republic."" Will Bunch also stresses the case, drawing on an 1870 Ku Klux Klan Act, symbolizes ""the virus that has sapped democracy on this continent"" - the white supremacy that's always marked Trump's life. His racist father, the Central Park Five, the Obama ""birther"" claims, the Mexican ""rapists,"" Muslim ban, ""shithole countries"" and race-based totems - they all coalesce in his fevered claim that voter fraud was coming from black communities in Democratic-run cities, who don't and shouldn't count. ""If we pretend this is just about Trump (and) some charges but we leave that part out,"" Bunch writes, ""we’re leaving the danger and the cancer still among us unaddressed.""After the latest charges were announced, the Bidens, vacationing in Delaware, went to see Christopher Nolan's film Oppenheimer. Trump took up the first of many, frenetic outbursts: witch hunt, fake charges, deranged Jack Smith, weaponized DOJ, election interference by the Biden Crime Family, who've sadly replaced Sleepy Joe. ""The lawlessness of these persecutions is reminiscent of Nazi Germany in the 1930s,"" he shrieked. ""President (sic) Trump has always followed the law and the Constitution, with advice from many highly accomplished attorneys."" LOL.They presumably included Rudy Giuliani, who now faces his own charges and in 2020 engendered ""clearly not an Ocean's 11 scheme when he unveiled a ""powerful smoking gun"" video about election fraud in Georgia - ""suitcases"" of illicit votes, ""double-counted"" ballots - that was quickly debunked as fantastical nonsense. Also John Lauro, who while seeking to defend his client appeared to confirm his guilt by telling Newsmax Trump did ask Pence to ""pause the voting"" so state legislatures could weigh in and re-audit, ""but what he didn't do is, you know, send in the tanks"" - one legal analyst: ""Sounds like a coup to me"" - and is now clumsily arguing ""a technical violation of the Constitution is not a violation of criminal law.""Trump, meanwhile, is using the once-cherished presidency as a Get-Out-of-Jail-Free card, working to parlay his newfound criminal fame into the White House. Last week he crowed, ""I need one more indictment to ensure my election,"" and his numbers - WTF MAGA - have in fact gone up. Following the infamous edict from Steve Bannon to ""flood the zone with shit,"" he's also been quietly plotting his revenge, reportedly assembling an imaginary government-in-waiting packed with MAGA lawyers, vengeful ""special counsels,"" pardon plans for goons and rioters, and other weapons of mass destruction to transform the DOJ into an instrument of his fascist agenda. Mostly, though, Trump is busy freaking out and (still) fucking up. Unable to listen to anyone else - think the ""many, many, many people"" who purportedly told him he lost the 2020 election - and despite stern warnings from Judge Chutkan not ""to try to influence or retaliate against witnesses"" - the petulant deadbeat who Just Can't STFU went back to his crappy fake-gold-encrusted McMansion and promptly began trying to influence, retaliate against and otherwise trash likely witnesses, starting with ""Liddle’ Mike Pence,"" who ""has gone to the Dark Side,"" was ""delusional,"" and is ""not a very good person."" Ha: Yuge Super Duper Ultra Pot/Kettle say what.Since then, he's kept at it, with much ketchup presumably thrown at walls as the reality of the possibility of prison time sinks in. After the Pence barb, he lost it and just went with browbeating everyone, thundering the very presidential, ""IF YOU GO AFTER ME, I’M COMING AFTER YOU!” When the post quickly raised eyebrows, a Trump ""spokesperson"" defended it (sic) as ""the definition of political speech,"" babbling it was ""in response to the RINO, China-loving, dishonest special interest groups and Super PACs, like the ones funded by the Koch brothers and the Club for No Growth."" Umm, okay. Alas, Jack Smith, who used to prosecute war criminals for a living, was uncowed; he promptly filed a court motion seeking a protective order from Judge Chutkan, citing the post's ""harmful chilling effect on witnesses,"" arguing ""there is no First Amendment right to threaten,"" and suggesting the danger of a loose-cannon Trump improperly sharing evidence in the case. Saturday, Judge Chutkan ordered Trump’s team to file a response to the motion by 5 p.m. Monday. They requested - delay, distract, delay - the deadline be moved to Thursday. She quickly denied the request, leaving 5 p.m. Monday the moment the Lock-Up-Everyone guy might, just, possibly be ordered locked up, for all our sakes.Yet he's still screeching. The lame free-speech ""defense"" was quickly followed by a venomous video, ""Welcome to the Fraud Squad,"" whose invective targets the four prosecutors, three black. Alvin Bragg is a ""radical liberal"" who ""refuses to prosecute violent criminals,"" Jack Smith ""made a career persecuting innocent Republican officials,"" Letitia James is an anti-Trump ""socialist,"" Atlanta D.A. Fani Willis, who's been subjected to a flood of racist threats and slurs (""Jim Crow Democrat whore"") is incompetent and corrupt besties with a gang member. All weekend, as his lawyers insisted on TV his crimes were ""aspirational,"" Truth Social posts howled: ""THERE IS NO WAY I CAN GET A FAIR TRIAL WITH THE JUDGE ‘ASSIGNED’ TO THE RIDICULOUS (CASE)...WE WILL BE IMMEDIATELY ASKING FOR RECUSAL OF THIS JUDGE ON VERY POWERFUL GROUNDS...IMPOSSIBLE to get a fair trial in Washington, D.C.,"" a ""high crime embarrassment"" for which ""I have called for a Federal TAKEOVER (to) bring our Capital back to Greatness."" Nancy Pelosi, who said he looked like a “scared puppy” at court, is ""a sick & demented psycho who will someday live in HELL!” (She also called the indictment “exquisite...beautiful and intricate.”) Biden made the U.S. women's team lose at the World Cup and ""the USA is going to Hell!!!” Even with the hysteria, writes Michael Moore, ""He's lucky to be an American."" Addressing, ""Dear Disgraced Indicted-Felon Man-Baby Ex-President,"" Moore admiringly cites ""the diversity (of) all the crimes...I’ve never seen anything like this, not even in a mob movie"" - though most have the same motive: ""To enrich yourself and to rule over us."" ""Here's to a speedy trial by a jury of your peers in four amazing American cities where the majority of the population happens not to be white,"" he adds. ""You, sir, live in the United States of America and we do not execute white billionaires. At least give us that."" For corroboration, Moore calls on esteemed Yale professor Timothy Snyder, historian of fascism and author of a clear-thinking Substack and the book On Tyranny - ""to abandon facts is to abandon freedom” - who since 2016 has been warning America is not so exceptional a coup couldn't happen here, like almost everywhere else in the world. Snyder offers the trenchant bottom line on Trump's arrogant, self-serving pity party for himself and his ""rights.""

Why would a former president with such a commanding lead deign to elevate his adversaries to rival status?If Trump shows up next week, he would face not just his nearest competitor, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, and his former vice president, Mike Pence, but also ex-New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a skilled brawler who has the potential to draw blood. There’s another reason Trump might think twice about debating: By skipping the first debate, Trump could set up DeSantis as everyone’s de facto target.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,Yes,6.025424078822121,92.27930474618827,99.62918906927982,33.665811430074335,79.38939089621597,75.33047734550266,gop debate,{},"{'debate': 'first', 'polls': 'national', 'president': 'former', 'lead': 'commanding', 'week': 'next', 'competitor': 'nearest', 'brawler': 'skilled', 'target': 'facto'}",1,1

Those efforts to stay in power included intimidating Georgia’s top elections official and recruiting fake electors to hijack the nation’s democratic process. Among the 19 people indicted Monday night were Trump personal attorney Rudy Giuliani, Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, election lawyer John Eastman, attorney Ken Chesebro, DOJ official Jeffrey Clark, Trump campaign lawyer Jenna Ellis, Trump campaign aide Mike Roman, and Trump campaign lawyer Sidney Powell.

The documents, first reported by the New York Times, urged DeSantis ""to take a sledgehammer” to Vivek Ramaswamy, the Republican entrepreneur who has slowly been gaining in the polls. Dub the primary opponent ""Fake Vivek"" or ""Vivek the Fake,"" the memo advised. Ramaswamy responded to the report Thursday afternoon, who called it ""another boring, establishment attack from Super PAC-creation 'Robot Ron' who is literally taking lame, pre-programmed attack lines against me for next week’s debate."" https://twitter.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1692202661410750526 The strategy documents indicate that DeSantis' campaign may view Ramaswamy as his biggest threat at the Aug. 23 debate, given that former President Donald Trump is not expected to participate. Ramaswamy, a political newcomer, has recently been closing the gap between him and DeSantis. A RealClearPolitics polling average between July 23-Aug. 15 shows Ramaswamy in third place with 6.7%, about eight points behind DeSantis. That's a 4.3-point increase for Ramaswamy in the last two months, compared to a 5.4-point decrease for DeSantis. And Ramaswamy is polling ahead of former Vice President Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Chris Christie—all of whom had bigger name recognition coming into the race than Ramaswamy. While the debate memo also encouraged DeSantis to defend Trump in absentia from attacks wielded by Christie, Trump has celebrated DeSantis' drop in polls, referencing a recent survey by RMG Research. The polling firm holds a B- rating from FiveThirtyEight. ""It’s over for Ron DeSanctimonious, now in 3rd place. Ramaswamy now in 2nd,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday. ""RMG Research.

It’s a weird scenario because the former would normally preclude the latter.Let’s start with the notion that he can’t beat Joe Biden. Anyone who watched Trump defy the experts in 2016 should be skeptical of such declarations. But according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, “53% of Americans say they would definitely not support [Trump] if he is the nominee.”This leaves Trump with 47% of the electorate that is “gettable,” which is an important caveat when you consider that he picked the Electoral College lock by winning just 46% of the popular vote in 2016. However, in addition to the 53% who definitely won’t vote for Trump in 2024, “Another 11% say they would probably not support him in November 2024”—which is to say that 64% of voters are unlikely to support Trump.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,No,4.157400035541261,84.31483480231822,99.94170037430908,2.6531499258410407,79.51854726559654,77.60782222208505,trump voters,{},"{'polls': 'recent', 'primary': 'republican', 'scenario': 'weird', 'declarations': 'such', 'poll': 'recent', 'caveat': 'important', 'vote': 'popular'}",0,1

The former president is the most notorious Twitter user of all time. Trump’s Twitter era was really something. It gave us new words—covfefe, hamberder—nasty nicknames for his many enemies, nearly started a nuclear war, and, prosecutors say, inspired the Capitol riot. Bigots everywhere were emboldened by the racism Trump peppered the internet with. Would Charlottesville have happened if he hadn’t called Mexicans “rapists,” blamed Black and Hispanic people for crime, and pledged to ban all Muslims from entering the country—all before he was president? Given his history, it shouldn’t have come as a surprise that he said white nationalists who attended the deadly riot were “very fine people.” Yet it was so appalling that over a quarter of his cybersecurity council quit in protest. His comment section alone launched the careers of multitudes of reply guys and gals. (It was also fertile ground for the bot networks that sprouted in his wake.) And the memes, oh the many, many memes. His presidency was terrible for the country, but it was great for Twitter, which now desperately wants you to call it X. (Never gonna happen.) It was probably a bitter day in Market Square when Twitter finally suspended him after the Capitol riot. Other platforms also gave him the heave-ho in the wake of the violent attempt to overthrow democracy. Today the septuagenarian ex-POTUS is still lying through his thumbs on the ironically named Truth Social. But that MAGA echo chamber doesn’t have the same je ne sais quoi. Trump has resumed using Facebook, Instagram, and YouTube, which reinstated him earlier this year. He also maintains accounts on Truth Social and Rumble. He must still be salty over that Twitter suspension, though. The platform lifted its ban last year, but to this day, he hasn’t returned to his once-favorite platform, no matter how much Elon Musk probably wishes he would. Dirtiest Delete Trump has made some seriously bad posts in his time online. He’s got something of a gift for it. In one of his worst missives, he castigated former Vice President Mike Pence for lacking the “courage” to violate his oath of office by overturning the 2020 election. The tweet was so bad even Trump had the sense to delete it. It’s one dirty delete that may come up in a criminal trial someday soon.

This court-enforced deadline comes as a result of years of tireless advocacy from communities across the country and a corresponding lawsuit filed by Earthjustice on behalf of California Communities Against Toxics, Clean Power Lake County, Rio Grande International Study Center, Sierra Club, and Union of Concerned Scientists. Initially filed in December 2022, the lawsuit challenged EPA’s failure to take legally required action to protect the public from harmful carcinogenic air emissions from ethylene oxide sterilization facilities. “Today’s consent decree signing is a critical step to ensuring that communities across the U.S. get needed protections from ethylene oxide emissions from commercial sterilizers. For years, EPA has promised new regulations to rein in commercial sterilizers’ toxic ethylene oxide emissions,” said Earthjustice Senior Attorney Marvin Brown. “And after years of missing their own deadlines, we sued and secured a judicially enforceable deadline. Now EPA must do its part and ensure that its sterilizer rule protects communities from this cancer-causing pollution.” Ethylene oxide is a colorless, typically odorless, flammable gas used to sterilize medical equipment and in the production of chemicals needed for antifreeze, plastics, detergents, and adhesives. It is one of the most toxic air pollutants EPA regulates. This toxic chemical is a known carcinogen to humans, especially when inhaled. EPA updated ethylene oxide’s toxicity value in 2016 and admits that the chemical is 60 times more toxic than previously estimated. Despite this new assessment, it has taken EPA seven years to propose new standards while countless people and their families were left vulnerable to chronic — sometimes fatal — health impacts of ethylene oxide exposure. Now, the agency must use the best-available science to enact the strongest possible protections to ensure that impacted communities will not continue to be subjected to exposure to this aggressive carcinogen. Quotes from our Clients: “As a result of the collaboration of environmental justice communities and national environmental organizations, today marks a monumental step towards cleaner air,” said Celeste Flores, Clean Power Lake County (IL) steering committee member. “We are one step closer to ensuring that the EPA finalizes the crucial commercial sterilizer rules for EtO. We urge the EPA to act swiftly and pass the strongest regulations for healthy communities.” “EPA must adopt strong, health-protective enforceable limits on ethylene oxide for our nation’s 78 sterilizers and their warehouses that include fenceline monitoring to verify those limits are being met,” stated Jane Williams of California Communities Against Toxics. “Thank goodness that we have groups like Earthjustice to fight for us so that agencies like the EPA do much more to protect communities like ours that face extremely high cancer level risks due to dangerous ethylene oxide emissions from commercial sterilizer companies like Midwest Sterilization,” said Tricia Cortez of Rio Grande International Study Center in Laredo, TX. “We need the EPA to pass the strongest rule possible, as quickly as possible.” “Families across Texas have been forced to grapple with the pervasive health and environmental impacts of ethylene oxide emissions. EPA’s harmful inaction on regulating ethylene oxide has benefitted the profits of the sterilizer industry at the expense of the health and well-being of countless families,” said Neil Carman, Sierra Club’s Lone Star Chapter’s Clean Air Program Director. “Now the clock is ticking for the agency needs to act as swiftly as possible to finalize the strongest possible protections for the environment and public health.”",Common Dreams,Top,No,4.131643657777154,99.6880643474029,93.03915841272668,2.2255463154664707,75.55532406551401,75.44495209406088,decade missed,{},"{'updates': 'needed', 'deadline': 'enforceable', 'advocacy': 'tireless', 'lawsuit': 'corresponding', 'action': 'required', 'emissions': 'dangerous', 'step': 'monumental', 'protections': 'possible', 'sterilizers': 'commercial', 'regulations': 'strongest', 'deadlines': 'own', 'pollution': 'causing', 'gas': 'flammable', 'equipment': 'medical', 'pollutants': 'toxic', 'chemical': 'toxic', 'carcinogen': 'aggressive', 'oxide': 'updated', 'assessment': 'new', 'standards': 'new', 'people': 'countless', 'impacts': 'pervasive', 'science': 'available', 'communities': 'healthy', 'justice': 'environmental', 'organizations': 'environmental', 'air': 'cleaner', 'member': 'steering', 'rules': 'commercial', 'limits': 'enforceable', 'level': 'high', 'companies': 'commercial', 'rule': 'possible', 'inaction': 'harmful', 'families': 'countless', 'health': 'public'}",0,0

The department plans to hold the sale Sept. 27. Lease Sale 261, which the Biden administration canceled in 2021, is the last of three offshore oil and gas lease sales mandated under the Inflation Reduction Act. Lease Sales 258 and 259, held in December 2022 and March 2023, were also revived by the IRA. Those lease sales were challenged in federal court for failing to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act.Today’s lawsuit challenges the upcoming lease sale for violating NEPA because Interior did not consider the health threats to Gulf Coast communities living near oil refineries and other polluting drilling infrastructure. The department also failed to adequately consider the climate harm from this massive new source of fossil fuel production. The lease sale could result in the production of more than 1 billion barrels of oil and 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over the next 50 years, resulting in more than 370 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions.The department agreed to limit the leasing area to reduce the risk of driving the endangered Rice’s whale to extinction. Scientists estimate there may be only 51 Rice’s whales left on Earth.The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the District of Columbia on behalf of Healthy Gulf, Bayou City Waterkeeper, Friends of the Earth, Center for Biological Diversity, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Sierra Club.In September, Interior is expected to release its final proposed five-year program for offshore oil and gas leasing. The plan, which lasts through 2028, could include as many as 11 new offshore lease sales. Holding 11 new fossil fuel auctions would sanction up to 70 years of additional fossil-fuel extraction with the potential to emit up to 3.5 billion tons of carbon pollution.Statements from Earthjustice, its clients and partners:“Once again, the Biden administration has fallen short of the federal law by neglecting to consider the impact of this massive oil sale on Gulf communities and the climate,” said Earthjustice attorney George Torgun. “We’re pleased that Interior excluded habitat for the nearly extinct Gulf of Mexico whale from this lease sale, but it’s equally critical that Interior builds on this step and protects climate and Gulf communities from the harms of leasing.”“Unfortunately, given BOEM’s history of sacrificing the Gulf of Mexico to Big Oil, this lease sale decision comes as no surprise,” said Hallie Templeton, legal director of Friends of the Earth. “Our lawsuit should also come as no surprise, since BOEM continues to rely on the same outdated, broken environmental analysis. If we are going to make a dent in the climate crisis, business as usual must stop. We are going to keep fighting until the Gulf of Mexico is off the table for good.”“As steward of the country’s public lands and waters, Interior has a duty to fully consider the harms offshore leasing can cause, from air pollution to oil spills, and beyond,” said Julia Forgie, attorney for NRDC (the Natural Resources Defense Council). “This vast lease sale — for millions of acres — poses threats to Gulf communities and endangered species while contributing to the climate crisis this region knows far too well. We are holding the agency to its obligation to carefully assess these risks and the climate fallout of this giveaway to Big Oil.”“It’s mind-boggling that in this summer of deadly fossil fuel-driven record heat, fires and flooding the Biden administration couldn’t be bothered to look carefully at the damage this lease sale will cause to people, endangered wildlife and the climate,” said Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Across the country we’re seeing lethal wildfires, boiling ocean temperatures and mass coral die-offs, all caused or exacerbated by a climate unnaturally warmed by fossil fuel emissions. We’ve got to stop letting oil and gas companies make it worse by drilling in our oceans.”“It is time to transition away from fossil fuels,” said Kristen Schlemmer, legal director and waterkeeper for Bayou City Waterkeeper. “Continued development in the Gulf of Mexico creates unfair burdens on communities in Houston and across the Gulf South. Moving forward with Lease Sale 261 means more drilling in the years to come. It means more facilities in our backyards. It means higher rates of cancer and heart and lung diseases, and it means more risks during major storms.”“Selling public lands and waters to Big Polluters is incompatible with achieving the ambitious climate goals the Biden Administration itself has set,” said Devorah Ancel, Sierra Club Environmental Law Program senior attorney. “Fossil fuel extraction is destructive to communities, ecosystems, wildlife, and our climate. The devastating effects of climate change, from heat waves to storms, are particularly harmful to frontline communities, as this summer has shown. Moving forward with this lease sale locks us into extraction for decades to come, right as we should be transitioning to clean energy.”",Common Dreams,Top,No,4.131643657777154,95.67104125795176,99.6890646832138,2.2255463154664707,75.55532406551401,75.44495209406088,lawsuit massive,{},"{'groups': 'environmental', 'sale': 'vast', 'sales': 'new', 'court': 'federal', 'infrastructure': 'polluting', 'source': 'new', 'feet': 'cubic', 'gas': 'natural', 'years': 'next', 'program': 'proposed', 'leasing': 'offshore', 'lease': 'offshore', 'auctions': 'new', 'extraction': 'additional', 'fuel': 'fossil', 'law': 'federal', 'director': 'legal', 'analysis': 'environmental', 'lands': 'public', 'species': 'endangered', 'heat': 'driven', 'wildlife': 'endangered', 'wildfires': 'lethal', 'fuels': 'fossil', 'development': 'continued', 'burdens': 'unfair', 'drilling': 'more', 'facilities': 'more', 'rates': 'higher', 'risks': 'more', 'storms': 'major', 'goals': 'ambitious', 'attorney': 'senior', 'effects': 'devastating'}",0,0
2171,Pence,2023-08-25,"""In a Summer of Climate Chaos, Fed Summit Ignores Risk of Climate Crisis to Global Economy""","Today, over 70 international, national and state/local organizations released an open letter to the Federal Reserve and central bankers attending this year’s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. The letter calls on symposium participants to act quickly and vigorously to address recent escalations in climate-related financial risks. In remarks this morning, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell omitted any mention of climate-related financial risks in his Jackson Hole speech. The open letter notes that climate change impacts are outpacing authorities’ current efforts to address climate change financial risks. This is evidenced by escalating costs of physical risks and growing gaps in insurance coverage, among other things. Policy makers, especially in the banking and insurance sectors, must: Adopt a precautionary approach to risk mitigation, given climate change’s tipping points and unpredictable tail risks. This could include capital adjustments and other mechanisms to properly reflect the risk of fossil fuel production and thus facilitate a transition;Design capital buffers that specifically take into account the systemic risks of climate change;Require the use of forward-looking tools, such as transition plans, which can help both authorities and market participants better understand and mitigate their own climate-related transition risks, as well as improve understanding of aggregated, systemic risks and promote accountability. Elizabeth Jacobs, a Sustainable Finance Specialist at E3G said: “Jackson Hole is a unique setting, and not only for its natural beauty. At the 2005 Jackson Hole Symposium, warnings about risks building up in the financial system were minimized. Within the next 5 years, the Global Financial Crisis ensued, and policy makers were promptly consumed with giving themselves new authorities designed to avert future crises. Using precautionary approaches and transition plans can help avoid a ruinous rinse, wash, repeat cycle.”Alex Martin, Climate Finance Policy Director at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund said: “Financial regulators have put in increasing effort in recent years to try to understand and better manage climate risk, but unfortunately, climate change is vastly outpacing their progress. Precious little time remains to get ahead of the risk as insurers flee vulnerable areas and banks respond in kind. Resigning ourselves to merely picking up the pieces after climate-driven financial disruptions and crises unfold—which is where we are headed—is utterly unacceptable. Regulators must double down now.""David Arkush, director of Public Citizen’s Climate Program, said: “It is shocking that this symposium, which purports to address structural shifts in the global economy, does not include a single agenda item on the climate crisis or climate solutions — some of the most important drivers of change in the global economy and most significant sources of risk to global financial stability. Rather than stand by as the next global financial crisis develops, the top officials and economists at this conference should be actively considering responses and solutions. And the officials should adopt assertive policies that shepherd the economy and financial system swiftly and safely through the tumultuous climate-related transitions that are already underway.”Jackie Fielder, co-director of Stop the Money Pipeline coalition said: “Any symposium entitled ‘Structural Shifts in the Global Economy’ without a single mention of climate disasters and the billions they have cost everyday people and local economies, should concern every American with a pension who agrees that climate change is here.”Akiksha Chatterji, lead campaigner at Positive Money US said: ""Regulators are failing to act at the scale or pace necessary to curb the significant financial stability threats arising from climate change and fossil fuel financing. Rest assured, climate risks will materialise and we simply cannot quantify the precise nature and timing of these impacts as they are complex and ever changing. Emergency measures taken after a climate-driven financial crash may not suffice to contain such a meltdown. It’s time for the regulators and officials at this symposium to adopt a precautionary approach to climate and do their jobs before another financial crisis ensues.""",Common Dreams,Top,No,4.131643657777154,50.57979995962875,90.95323051920332,2.2255463154664707,75.55532406551401,75.44495209406088,climate summer,{},"{'organizations': 'international', 'letter': 'open', 'bankers': 'central', 'escalations': 'recent', 'risks': 'systemic', 'efforts': 'current', 'gaps': 'growing', 'things': 'other', 'approach': 'precautionary', 'mechanisms': 'other', 'buffers': 'transition;design', 'tools': 'looking', 'setting': 'unique', 'beauty': 'natural', 'system': 'financial', 'years': 'recent', 'authorities': 'new', 'crises': 'future', 'approaches': 'precautionary', 'rinse': 'ruinous', 'regulators': 'financial', 'effort': 'increasing', 'time': 'little', 'areas': 'vulnerable', 'disruptions': 'financial', 'shifts': 'structural', 'economy': 'global', 'item': 'single', 'drivers': 'important', 'sources': 'significant', 'stability': 'financial', 'crisis': 'financial', 'officials': 'top', 'policies': 'assertive', 'transitions': 'related', 'mention': 'single', 'people': 'everyday', 'economies': 'local', 'pace': 'necessary', 'threats': 'significant', 'nature': 'precise', 'crash': 'financial'}",0,0

Soros! Hunter! abortion up to birth! Trans Marxists in bathrooms! - as sorry also-rans in a bleakly unpresidential race to the bottom. For Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, today's GOP evokes T.S. Eliot’s The Hollow Men: “This is the way the world ends/Not with a bang but a whimper.” Trump, of course, skipped the Fox-aired ""debate"" between clowns and thugs to witlessly blather with Tucker Carlson, who a few months ago declared of the multi-indicted former etc, ""I hate him passionately""; still, they gamely rambled through the vital issues of the day: the possible murder of Jeffrey Epstein - ""I will say he was a fixture in Palm Beach"" - by Bill Barr; ""the Left"" as ""savage animals...really sick""; the deep state plot to limit water in washing machines; Jan. 6 rioters behaving ""peacefully and patriotically."" Many chose not to watch either Trump or his fellow-cretins; explained one patriot, ""I was too busy working on my 'Mugshots of Treason' collectible trading cards."" For those unfortunates who ventured forth to bear witness to two hours of fascist-flavored gas-lighting, fear-mongering, ""substanceless statements"" and ""gelatinous ideas"" cheered on by an audience of gullible, complicit yahoos, they beheld a toxic yet vacant party that ""has become meaner, dumber, and wholly divorced from the issues Americans actually care about."" It was, argued Peter Birkenhead, like ""watching cancer cells debate health.""The event seemed even more bizarre in light of the next day's arrest of the felon who leads them all by an incomprehensible mile. Reflecting the warped, alternate reality in which their party now resides, candidates gamely pretended there was some actual reason for them to be lumbering through a contest both ""chaotic and boring,"" devoid of ideas or principles but steeped in belligerent buzzwords and ""word-salad recitation of right-wing talking points""; even so, they largely rallied the domestic terrorist troops only at ominous nods to China, Mexico, Soros, teachers' unions and other fictional seeds of their discontent. Even there in placid, mid-Western Milwaukee, the thematic darkness was clear from an incendiary opening montage of protesters, immigrants, burning cities, rampaging crime, all the evils Trump raged about in his famously deranged inaugural vow, “This American carnage stops right here and right now” - which George Bush later dubbed ""some weird shit."" Yes, but still weirdly persisting. ""Republican debates once were celebrations of American greatness,"" notes Eugene Robinson. ""Now, they are wallows in American grievance.""Thus did all eight candidates, voicing the affronted victimhood of today's right wing, labor to portray ""the wealthiest, most powerful country on Earth as some kind of hellish dystopia."" They feverishly cited civic mayhem, urban rubble, the imaginary threats of immigrant hordes, Marxist mobs, CRT and swimming trans kids and abortion ""all the way up to the moment of birth"" (which doesn't exist) while - irony alert - universally rejecting climate change, the one real danger confronting us, as ""a hoax."" ""It is not morning in America - we live in a dark moment,” declaimed businessman, loudmouth and wannabe demagogue Vivek Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old, wildly uninformed political novice who insisted, ""We're in the middle of a national identity crisis,"" maybe thanks to a presidential contender in such moronic denial of climate change he shrilly promises to ""drill, frack, burn coal, embrace nuclear"" while claiming ""more people are dying of bad climate change policies than (of) actual climate change."" More of his red-meat nuggets of wisdom: The nuclear family is ""the greatest form of governance known to mankind,"" the ""only war I will declare as President will be the war on the federal administrative state!” and, straight-faced, ""Trump is the best president of the 21st century.""Along with brazenly, incongruously stealing Obama lines - ""Who the heck is this skinny guy with a funny last name?"" he suggested the audience was thinking - Ramaswamy proved the ""weirdest guy on stage,"" surpassing even weird DeSantis, in his garish performance as a ""Trumpier than Trump"" huckster who, like ""your annoying college roommate,"" eagerly jumps into every exchange despite having no idea what he's talking about. Hence, some barbed exchanges: To his claim we shouldn't support Ukraine, Nikki Haley snapped, “You are choosing a murderer over a pro-American country. You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows."" Bizarrely, it was Ramaswamy who led the cheer-leading charge for Trump - while ostensibly running against him - after co-moderator Bret Baier announced ""a brief moment (to) talk about the elephant not in the room."" When Baier asked the motley assemblage who'd still support for ""president"" the thug facing 91 felony charges if he's convicted, Ramaswamy's hand shot up, followed by Tim Scott, Doug Burgum and Haley; excruciatingly, they were slowly joined by a sheepish Pence though Trump tried to get him hung, and shamefaced profile in courage DeSantis after he looked to see what everyone else did. The crowd cheered.DeSantis was widely deemed the evening's biggest loser, alternately angry, evasive, rictus-grimacing, stiffly canned - ""Send Joe Biden back to his basement!"" - and wooden even when issuing murderous edicts on migrants: ""We're going (to) leave them stone-cold dead."" He often appeared notably clueless: Asked, ""How would you fix the American economy?"", he responded, ""You bring Anthony Fauci (now a retired doctor) into the Oval Office (and) you say, ‘ANTHONY YOU ARE FIRED!’” Umm. He also trashed Hunter Biden's ""lousy paintings,"" criticized ""lockdowns"" that don't exist, crudely bragged about the evils he's inflicted on Florida, dodged a question on a national abortion ban but said he loved his kids' sonograms and wants ""a culture of life,"" told a freakish, bogus story - ""I know a lady in Florida"" though it was Michigan - about a woman born alive in 1955 after a botched abortion, threw in a quick anti-Semitic jab at ""George-Soros backed"" prosecutors ""victimizing innocent people,"" and oddly declined to use his fave term ""woke"" (Nikki Halley did once with ""crazy, woke things"" in schools) though he's proudly, ceaselessly proclaimed ad nauseum, ""Florida is where woke goes to die."" Huh. Now it seems Milwaukee is where it, and he, will meet their welcome, unseemly end.Sadly but predictably, the other incoherent also-rans didn't fare any better. Asked about crime, Tim Scott said the first thing he'd do is fire Merrick Garland; he also often said ""single-parent household"" and ""God’s green Earth."" Asked about the economy, Mike Pence boasted he and Trump added three zealots to the Supreme Court; he also reminded an audience of mindless, bloodthirsty, GOP nihilists he ""upheld the Constitution"" but didn't admit, per Chris Hayes, it was 'cause he ""didn't want to be another guy with a mugshot."" Nikki Haley thought there might be climate change but still China, China, China, also India. Nobody mentioned gun violence that's now the leading killer of kids in America, though this weekend saw another shooting, in DeSantis' assault-rifle-filled Florida, with ""mass fatalities."" All told, the ""debate"" laid bare a party ""unmoored from reality,"" bereft of ideas, values or policies and filling the vacuum with culture wars, racist tropes, ugly scapegoating. It struck Roy Edroso, who ""watched as much as I could,"" as ""something out of a neurological experiment,"" clearly not benign. He saw a cheap ""trunk show...loud, fast, and out of control,"" with no winners: ""Nobody...not even the screamers, expects to see a president come out of this.""Many concurred on a malignant shipwreck of a party hollowed out and stripped down to its meanest, rankest parts by a two-bit grifter - now hawking ""Never Surrender"" mugs and t-shirts marking his 4th surrender - who's left behind the ragged survivors to sink or less-than-convincingly swim. For fans of Succession, the debate's shabby specimens evoked Logan Roy's searing, mournful appraisal of his dysfunctional offspring: ""You are not serious people."" Noticeably escaping unscathed from the GOP debacle was Joe Biden, who happily embraced his no-malarkey alter-ego Dark Brandon, complete with laser-shooting eyes, in some strong messaging on Fox and around Milwaukee. Billboards featuring Biden/Brandon brashly declared, ""Social Security Cuts? Try Me"" and ""Get Real Jack. I'm Bringing Roe Back."" Biden was also on X, the dumb new name for Twitter, snarking away. To the inane claim climate change is ""a hoax,"" he retorted, “Climate change is real, by the way”; to Haley's admission that Trump added $8 billion to the national debt, he wrote, ""What she said."" And when the whole mess mercifully ended, he added a common-sense, real-world adage from his father. ""You know, my dad used to say, 'Don't compare me to the Almighty,'"" he wrote. ""'Compare me to the alternative.""",Common Dreams,Top,No,4.920157774876589,64.41013061645792,99.96438505356622,15.31634217158676,74.2015232560169,89.09031120936056,hollow men,{},"{'spectacle': 'surreal', 'cranks': 'tawdry', 'pygmies': 'political', 'rans': 'sorry', 'race': 'unpresidential', 'debate': 'aired', 'months': 'few', 'issues': 'vital', 'murder': 'possible', 'animals': 'savage', 'plot': 'deep', 'cards': 'collectible', 'statements': 'substanceless', 'ideas': 'gelatinous', 'yahoos': 'gullible', 'party': 'unmoored', 'day': 'next', 'mile': 'incomprehensible', 'reality': 'alternate', 'reason': 'actual', 'contest': 'chaotic', 'buzzwords': 'belligerent', 'recitation': 'salad', 'wing': 'right', 'points': 'wing', 'troops': 'terrorist', 'nods': 'ominous', 'seeds': 'fictional', 'darkness': 'thematic', 'montage': 'incendiary', 'cities': 'burning', 'vow': 'inaugural', 'carnage': 'american', 'shit': 'weird', 'debates': 'republican', 'greatness': 'american', 'grievance': 'american', 'victimhood': 'affronted', 'country': 'american', 'dystopia': 'hellish', 'mayhem': 'civic', 'rubble': 'urban', 'threats': 'imaginary', 'mobs': 'marxist', 'danger': 'real', 'moment': 'brief', 'businessman': 'declaimed', 'novice': 'political', 'crisis': 'national', 'contender': 'presidential', 'denial': 'moronic', 'coal': 'burn', 'people': 'serious', 'policies': 'bad', 'change': 'actual', 'meat': 'red', 'family': 'nuclear', 'form': 'greatest', 'war': 'only', 'state': 'administrative', 'president': 'best', 'century': '21st', 'guy': 'weirdest', 'name': 'new', 'performance': 'garish', 'roommate': 'annoying', 'exchanges': 'barbed', 'policy': 'foreign', 'charge': 'leading', 'loser': 'angry', 'edicts': 'murderous', 'economy': 'american', 'doctor': 'retired', 'paintings': 'lousy', 'ban': 'national', 'story': 'bogus', 'abortion': 'botched', 'jab': 'semitic', 'term': 'fave', 'nauseum': 'proclaimed', 'end': 'unseemly', 'thing': 'first', 'parent': 'single', 'nihilists': 'bloodthirsty', 'killer': 'leading', 'fatalities': 'mass', 'tropes': 'racist', 'experiment': 'neurological', 'show': 'loud', 'shipwreck': 'malignant', 'parts': 'rankest', 'surrender': '4th', 'survivors': 'ragged', 'specimens': 'shabby', 'appraisal': 'mournful', 'offspring': 'dysfunctional', 'eyes': 'shooting', 'messaging': 'strong', 'claim': 'inane', 'debt': 'national', 'mess': 'whole', 'sense': 'common', 'world': 'real'}",1,1
