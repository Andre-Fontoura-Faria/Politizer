76,Scott,2023-04-18,"""Loyal Friends of the NRA Vow to Save Our Guns and Fridges""","Celebrating a ""freedom-filled weekend,"" gun freaks just flocked to another NRA confab - Wall of Guns! Rifles for Two-Year-Olds! Defend Against Radical Lunatics! - to champion their sacred right to add to our bloody carnage. Among a swarm of GOP pols, the Orange Nazi memorably decried yuge gangs of ""communist maniacs"" attacking ""apartment stores"" and carting off refrigerators, air conditioners, ""fur coats, not fur coats, everything."" No wonder they wanna vote for him.The weekend's three-day NRA convention, held in Indianapolis, featured the usual delights: National Prayer Breakfast, Youth Day, much merch - I Am the NRA t-shirts, Don't Tread On Me mugs, NRA: I Am Freedom stickers - and acres of exhibits: Humvees, AR-15 Build Kits ($299), shiny new guns like Colt's bolt-action TacHunter, mini-compact handguns, aluminum M1911-style handguns with 11-round flush-fit magazine capacity, 2023's Gun of the Year Springfield Armory SA-35 9mm with NRA Grips. Because, for retailers, ""NRA members are your best customers! Can you afford to not be here?"" Distressingly, there were also many, many, sweet Jesus too many small children wistfully fingering large guns. Outside the convention, protesters took turns reading the names of the roughly 1,600 American kids killed by guns last year. Organizer Mary Tuttle noted that Indiana lawmakers just passed a bill banning gender-affirming care for minors but declined to act on gun violence, though, ""Zero children have died from puberty blockers. Not one."" Given that, in part thanks to NRA lobbying, Americans have stockpiled over 400 million guns - more weaponry than the Armed Forces, Dept. of Homeland Security, and local police agencies combined - attendees were also greeted by a billboard by Mad Dog PAC reading, ""The NRA Is A Terrorist Organization.""The convention, its stage emblazoned with ""Defend Your Freedom,"" came days after mass shootings at a Nashville school and a Louisville bank, and on the second anniversary of a mass shooting at an Indianapolis FedEx that killed nine people; last year's ever-fearless NRA held their convention days after the school massacre in Uvalde, Texas. Thoughts and prayers all around; the show must go on. Still, NRA organizers boasted the convention was ""the safest place in the USA to be today"" because - WTF - guns were banned as too dangerous. Thus did GOP Presidential hopefuls comfortably, dutifully assemble to kiss the blood-spattered ring of beleaguered NRA CEO, ghoul and thug Wayne LaPierre, who warned, “Gun-hating politicians should never go to bed unafraid of what this association, and all of our millions of members, can do to their political careers."" Some pols phoned it in: Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Ron DeathSantis, who fresh from his pudding bragged that, even after the slaughter of 17 innocents at Parkland, he's ""resisted calls to take up gun control even when such a stand is superficially unpopular,” as though Floridians are only superficially opposed to being gunned down in America's usual killing fields - schools, malls, synagogues, grocery stores etc. He also ran an ad trashing Trump for evidently once suggesting - horrors - maybe the killing should stop.In person, a long list of mostly unknown speakers echoed him; those with higher profiles battled to go ever lower. Asa Hutchinson warned ""Joe Biden and the gun-control extremists (to) give up your pipe-dreams of gun compensation in this free society. Stop endangering our lives with gun bans and stop tramping on the rights of the American people every time tragedy happens."" Vivek Ramaswamy called for more firepower and less CRT in schools, and shutting down the FBI/ATF: ""What does the AR-15 stand for? It stands for freedom."" New Hampshire's Chris Sununu mocked Biden, bragged he vetoed a gun law - cheers - and told the feds to ""shove it."" Mike Pence got booed in his own state - ""I love you too"" - urged more armed guards, sent prayers to the latest dead kids. South Dakota's newly big-lipped, hair-extensioned Gov. Kristi Noem won cheers when she declared ""I am the NRA"" to prove it's not just old white guys - cameraman pans to audience of old white guys; ominously intoned, ""Liberals and Joe Biden want our guns because it will make it easier for them to infringe on all our other rights""; proposed after massacres, ""families gathered together (and) prayed for wisdom and discernment on how to heal hearts and minds""; and eerily boasted her 2-year-old granddaughter ""already owns a shotgun and rifle and soon will need them."" (Twitter: ""And my dog has three books and a calculator."")But Trump, “the most pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment president,” took the gun-nuttery cake, vowing, “I will be your loyal friend and fearless champion,"" like during ""the China virus"" when ""I proudly designated gun dealers as critical infrastructure."" Before the Die-Hard revenge fantasies, he made bombastic claims about his ""epic struggle"" against Dems who ""want to take away your guns while throwing open jailhouse doors and releasing bloodthirsty criminals...to abolish your borders and impoverish your families...to demonize patriots and persecute Christians while pushing the transgender cult.” Whew. It was then he went on his ""refrigerator-theft blast"" about ""these gangs of hundreds of young people (who) go and attack an apartment... department stores"" (in Dem-run cities) and ""they’re running out carrying refrigerators (and) air conditioners and big stuff. Big, little, everything. Fur coats, not fur coats, everything...They empty out the stores."" And then the police are ""standing there, they're shaking, they want to do their job, but they're not allowed to do their job because of these radical lunatics,"" even though they won't admit most violent crime is ""committed by a brutal class of hardened repeat criminals. That’s who’s doing it. In San Francisco..."" Also, tents in D.C. - ""I had to take them down immediately"" - and ""incredible monuments"" and ""beautiful lawns"" and ""the only one they want to prosecute is Donald Trump, let's get him, it's unbelievable."" Yes. It is. This evil, inept, barking mad clown - who says our mass slaughter ""is not a gun problem"" but a spiritual problem maybe abetted by ""genetically engineered cannabis"" - is the leading GOP candidate for president. Twitter had thoughts: ""Seems totally real. In fact, many people strongly say they see people running with 300-lb refrigerators strapped on their backs while wearing fur coats...They don't even put the fridges under their coats like the old days...They're taking gas stoves too just in case...With tears in their eyes?...Never mind the diamonds and tablets - grab that fridge!...They’re taking the refrigerators 'cause there isn’t strong enough water pressure when they flush the toilets on account of the birds being killed by windmills...I have seen peoople, thugs if you will, carrying 1 fish, even 2 fish, I even saw them with a red fish and a blue fish, just lawlessness everywhere...Since I'm anti-fur, I would suggest the looters stick with 'non-fur' coats. Also, Sub Zero is the fridge you want...They grab 16-ton weights, moons, Mjollnir, everything. Sometimes they just pick up the store and run with it!...And they take things that happened, that didn’t happen, we'll take that for $500...And by the way, they’re coming for you: the liberals, the Blacks, the Jews. The drag queens want to steal your children. Have you bought a gun today?"" All the while, in a broken country where many hateful, lost, white, straight men ""stand back and stand by,"" hungry for control - ""Strength. Boots, smashing faces...My rifle is my best friend - without it I am useless"" - the shooting and killing goes on and on. America's most lethal weekend so far this year, Feb. 17 through Feb. 19, saw 10 mass shootings of over 50 victims: Nine children shot at a Georgia gas station, six people killed in a Mississippi town, eleven people shot in Memphis, five people shot in New Orleans, six people shot on a Chicago expressway. This last week has been almost as bloody. Thursday night, 16-year-old Ralph Yarl was shot in the head in Kansas City for knocking on a neighbor's door while black; miraculously, he survived, and prosecutors Monday night charged an 85-year-old white man with first-degree assault and armed criminal action. This weekend, with the NRA's obscenity underway, 38 people were shot, eight fatally, in gun violence across Chicago. Also this weekend, days after the Louisville bank shooting that killed four, a mass shooting at a sweet 16 birthday party in Alabama killed four and injured 32; a shooting at a crowded Chickasaw Park in Louisville left two dead and four injured. On Saturday, Mayor Craig Greenberg responded to the bloodshed with, ""This is not who we are."" Really? Lookit these kids at the NRA fest.

Helios’ value creation strategy over the investment period transformed the company into a leading distributor of speciality chemicals across the most important life sciences and industrial segments, drove the institutionalization of the business and positioned it for continued growth.

168,Scott,2023-05-22,"""Stand Up America Statement on Senator Tim Scott's Presidential Announcement""","Today, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) announced he will run for president in 2024. Scott enters the Republican primary against indicted former president Donald Trump and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. The candidates will reportedly be joined by fellow MAGA extremist and Trump understudy Ron DeSantis, who is expected to announce his candidacy in the coming days. Stand Up America’s spokesperson, Sarah Harris, issued the following statement:“Tim Scott has tried to cultivate the image of a Republican who stays above the MAGA fray, but his voting record says otherwise. From championing tax giveaways to the richest Americans and corporations to opposing federal legislation to protect voting rights, Scott has built his career voting against the interests of everyday Americans in South Carolina and across the country. “As we look ahead to the 2024 election, it’s critical that voters understand that the current roster of GOP candidates for president––Trump, Haley, DeSantis, and Scott––are all MAGA extremists who are a threat to our democracy and our freedoms. We must do everything in our power to ensure they are not sent to the Oval Office in 2025.”Scott has long been a champion for right-wing causes. As Senator, Scott has voted in lockstep with the MAGA agenda – opposing key legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act for gun safety legislation. Scott has also been a vocal supporter of tax cuts for billionaires and federal limits on reproductive justice. Despite his “moderate” persona, he remains a strong ally of Donald Trump and continues to perpetuate MAGA misinformation and vote against the interests of the American people. Stand Up America was founded in 2016 as a digital-first grassroots community working to resist Donald Trump and his cronies’ corruption, racism, and his threats to our democracy. From 2017 to 2021, our members made 1.7 million calls to Congress to oppose the MAGA extremist agenda. In 2020, our volunteers contacted 25 million voters to help defeat Trump and elect Joe Biden to the presidency. During the 2022 midterms, our team helped build a firewall for democracy ahead of 2024 by electing pro-democracy Secretaries of State in Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota, and Nevada, passing key democracy ballot initiatives, and mobilizing our members to get out the vote for progressive candidates nationwide. In 2024, our community will continue mobilizing to elect candidates who will stand up for our freedoms and our democracy.",Common Dreams,Business,No,1.655621722089205,77.3733697445463,91.6333426978332,25.657933513171557,61.186015767476604,69.61473919446927,america statement,{},"{'primary': 'republican', 'president': 'former', 'extremist': 'fellow', 'days': 'coming', 'legislation': 'key', 'roster': 'current', 'wing': 'right', 'causes': 'wing', 'supporter': 'vocal', 'limits': 'federal', 'justice': 'reproductive', 'persona': 'moderate', 'ally': 'strong', 'people': 'american', 'community': 'grassroots', 'agenda': 'extremist', 'initiatives': 'key', 'candidates': 'progressive'}",1,0

This is his second Tony nomination, after one in 2010 for his role in August Wilson’s Fences. “I think I could tolerate getting the Tony,” Henderson said drily. “I think I might find it in my capacity to tolerate it.

340,Scott,2023-06-09,"""Live From NBA Finals: ESPN Operations Weathers South Florida Storms, Cross-Country Travel for Heat-Nuggets Title Bout""","The Denver Nuggets played the role of spoiler and ruined the party for Miami Heat fans at Kaseya Center in Game 3 of the NBA Finals. With one more game to go in Southern Florida before shifting back to the Mile High City, ESPN’s operations team has withstood the challenges of this nation-spanning championship with logistical know-how and arduous planning. “[The Finals] have gone very smoothly, but a lot of our job is about reducing risk,” says Eddie Okuno, senior remote operations specialist, ESPN. “We always have to keep an eye on the calendar and the standings to see which cities we’ll be going to.” Game of Logistical Chess: Team Maps Out Potential Sites Prior to Finals From an operational perspective, one of the hardest parts about the job is foreseeing where the action will end up. At the beginning of the NBA Playoffs, many teams and their home cities were in the mix to host the NBA Finals, and the crew adjusted its plans as the postseason went along. By the Conference Finals, the potential sites had been reduced to four: Crypto.com Arena in Los Angeles and Ball Arena for the Western representative, TD Garden in Boston and Kaseya Center in Miami for its Eastern counterpart. At that stage, Okuno deployed a strategy to alleviate some of the stress that comes with the unknown. [caption id=""attachment_242286"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""682""] Eddie Okuno is at the helm of ESPN’s remote-operations team for the 2023 NBA Finals.[/caption] “Our strategy is to build City 1 and City 2 infrastructures that are identical between our two mobile-unit providers, NEP Group and Game Creek Video,” he says. “We stayed with our regular ABC Saturday Primetime strategy for the first two rounds, but, when we got to the Conference Finals, we just didn’t have time to set up everything for a big show in one day.” Luckily, the team on the NEP trucks knew fairly quickly that they’d be going to Denver when the Nuggets made relatively quick work of the Los Angeles Lakers. If the Lakers had made a dramatic comeback and the Heat finished off the Boston Celtics, the scenario would have changed, with the West Coast crew having to scramble to Los Angeles since the Lakers would have been the higher seed. When the Heat-Celtics series became a lot more interesting with a winner-take-all Game 7, the East Coast-based team knew that they’d be traveling regardless of the winner. As Boston gained momentum from a 3-0 hole, Okuno and company had to consider both cities as a possibility. “When we got to Game 6,” he says, “we had to start building out for Boston because the series would have ended on Monday, May 29 and we would have to be ready to go there for Game 1 on Thursday, June 1. Ultimately, Boston lost, and we headed out to Denver.” [caption id=""attachment_242288"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""715""] Game Creek Video 79, Victory, and Gotham are driving productions in Miami.[/caption] Sifting through cities and laying out scheduled departures requires moving a lot of parts, and each city has a unique venue. For example, the Milwaukee Bucks play in the four-year-old Fiserv Forum with an updated and broadcast-ready infrastructure. On the other hand, all the teams in the Conference Finals play in venues that opened before 2000. “We needed to know how much land or space would be given to us for our compound [at each venue] and when it would be available to us,” Okuno explains. “Between the NBA and the venues, there were multiple things that we had to coordinate.” Quick Thinking: Miami Thunderstorms Flood the Compound Playing ball in the Sunshine State comes with a hefty number of unexpected thunderstorms. Typically going as quickly as they come, these pockets of rain can still pack an aggressive punch. When you place these torrential downpours over a broadcast compound with equipment that isn’t compatible with water, producing games in Miami can be physically and figuratively slippery. Arriving at Kaseya Center May 30, the operations crew had a few days to construct a compound on a grass field before the surrounding area became too muddy. Although rain is always expected, it’s difficult to know when these storms hit, how much of a deluge they will bring, and how long they’ll stick around. [caption id=""attachment_242287"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""715""] The operations crew had to contend with flooding in the broadcast compound.[/caption] “When we first came here,” says Okuno, “the entire compound was flooded, and we were pretty much underwater by about almost 2 ft. We had to install pumping stations at the center of our compound and move the trucks out of that area.” Among other efforts to combat the problem, the temporary floor of the compound was built on a slant to enhance runoff and drainage. “[Unforeseen events] like that unfortunately happen,” he notes. “Fighting Mother Nature at this time of the year is always part of the challenge.” Production Standouts: Broadcast Includes Sony HDC-4800 Cinematic 4K Cameras Inside the venue, the team has a total of 55 camera feeds to choose from for the 1080p broadcast. Leading the way, the Sony HDC-4800 cinematic 4K camera is providing super-slow-motion shots at 8X speed. Sony has a large presence in the productions, with more than 30 cameras deployed in the lower bowl and around the arena, including 18 HDC-4300’s (five handhelds at speeds from 4X to 6X), two P-43’s above-the-rim robos, two HDC-5500’s, and two PXW-Z450’s. More important, the camera manufacturer plays a part in the Skycam system with a Sony HDC-P50 and in ESPN’s preferred shallow–depth-of-field rig with a Sony Alpha 1. [caption id=""attachment_242289"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""715""] Kaseya Center and the Miami skyline provide the backdrop for the compound.[/caption] In the compound, the efforts of the 85 credentialed personnel is centered on two sets of mobile units in each city. In Denver’s Ball Arena, NEP EN1 A, B, and C is handling the game and NCP2 studio coverage. Onsite at Miami’s Kaseya Center are Game Creek Video 79 A and B units and Victory B for the game and Gotham for studio coverage. Each broadcast is produced via multiple remote workflows. Through ESPN’s REMCO (remote-controlled) model, the onsite team integrates graphics and scorebug from operators at headquarters in Bristol, CT. Four EVS operators also are working out of the Bristol facility. As for lenses, all cameras are using Canon lenses in both Denver and Miami. For example, the Skycam is using a CJ20x5 lens, and others are leveraging the DIGISUPER 122x, the DIGISUPER 95x, the DIGISUPER 27x, CJ15ex4.3, and CJ20ex5 lenses. Additional Activity: Various Mixed-Reality Opens, Onsite Studio Show Besides the game production, the operations crew is pitching in on other activations at the NBA Finals. One of the most notable is seen at the beginning of the live telecast. Produced by ESPN Creative Services, a special mixed-reality (MR) open joins the graphics package that debuted at the start of the NBA regular season. The crew, led by Creative Director Lucas Nickerson, developed a new presentation for each game. The opens wouldn’t be possible without the technological foundation established by the operations team. [caption id=""attachment_242290"" align=""aligncenter"" width=""715""] The studio set in Miami is located near the corner of the court.[/caption] “We began testing these during the Conference Finals,” says Okuno. “Since it’s very time-sensitive with how we reveal it on Skycam, we wanted it done properly in terms of positioning and placement. We made a few adjustments for the Finals, and it has been working out extremely well.” In addition, technology is devoted to the onsite studio sets at each building. Anchored by five total cameras, two of the five are handheld and are shared with the game production. Close-Knit Group: ESPN Ops Leans on Experience, Trusted Broadcast Partners To produce a massive endeavor like the NBA Finals, a network needs the production and operations crews to work closely together. The creative vision from Lead Producer Tim Corrigan and Lead Director Mike Schwab is enhanced by impressive technology and a reliable working environment. Okuno and his team — Senior Technical Director Ross Flagg, Senior Audio Operator Scott Pray, Senior Audio Integration Devin Barnhart, Senior Comms Integration Patrick Martin, Senior Video Integration Mark Morel, Senior EVS Operator Nathan Beck, and Senior Media Specialist Scott Meglemre —work in sync not only internally but also with the production crew. “We’ve all done this job for a long time,” Okuno notes. “Our team is the best in the business. On the technical side, we keep things simple to make sure that everybody understands what we’re trying to do.” Another advantage of strong relationships year after year is knowing the valuable work done by vendors and manufacturers. Whether it’s working within technologically advanced mobile units from NEP Group and Game Creek Video, receiving the necessary energy resources from CES Power, the clean and durable flooring provided by Sunbelt Rentals, and more, external partners make a huge difference. “They’re just as important to us as anybody on our team,” says Okuno. “Everybody is invested in making sure that we have the best show possible.” Coverage of Game 4 of the 2023 NBA Finals will begin at 8:30 p.m. ET on Friday, June 9 on ABC.",Sports Video Group,Sports,No,2.9492334599830867,50.01009719701572,43.404230119312,65.59981157954606,78.33957433238874,51.21899044442412,nba finals,{},"{'championship': 'spanning', 'planning': 'how', 'specialist': 'senior', 'operations': 'remote', 'sites': 'potential', 'perspective': 'operational', 'parts': 'hardest', 'teams': 'many', 'representative': 'western', 'counterpart': 'eastern', 'unit': 'mobile', 'strategy': 'primetime', 'rounds': 'first', 'show': 'possible', 'work': 'valuable', 'comeback': 'dramatic', 'seed': 'higher', 'team': 'onsite', 'width=""715': 'align=""aligncenter', 'departures': 'scheduled', 'venue': 'unique', 'infrastructure': 'updated', 'hand': 'other', 'land': 'much', 'things': 'simple', 'number': 'hefty', 'thunderstorms': 'unexpected', 'punch': 'aggressive', 'downpours': 'torrential', 'games': 'producing', 'days': 'few', 'area': 'surrounding', 'compound': 'entire', 'efforts': 'other', 'floor': 'temporary', 'events': 'unforeseen', 'motion': 'slow', 'speed': '8x', 'presence': 'large', 'bowl': 'lower', 'rig': 'shallow', 'personnel': 'credentialed', 'units': 'mobile', 'workflows': 'remote', 'model': 'controlled', 'activity': 'additional', 'activations': 'other', 'telecast': 'live', 'reality': 'mixed', 'season': 'regular', 'presentation': 'new', 'foundation': 'technological', 'adjustments': 'few', 'sets': 'onsite', 'cameras': 'total', 'endeavor': 'massive', 'vision': 'creative', 'technology': 'impressive', 'environment': 'reliable', 'time': 'long', 'side': 'technical', 'relationships': 'strong', 'resources': 'necessary', 'flooring': 'clean', 'partners': 'external', 'difference': 'huge'}",1,0

The scale is going to be unlike anything anyone has realised previously, particularly in this business. To mobilise a team across Europe, from the UK through to Istanbul. And in a scale of sports, and a football pitch between two teams, whether you’ve got five yachts at sea in the Ocean Race, you’ve got mountain bikes, and Speedway Grand Prix at purpose-built venues. Find out more about what’s happening at the Weekend of Champions here You’ve got Le Mans 24 Hour at such an iconic racetrack, we’ll be going all day and all night, right through to the women’s rugby final taking place in Gloucester in the UK. Not only that, the women’s and men’s singles finals, along with the doubles finals, taking place at the iconic Roland-Garros. We have teams on the ground at every one of those events to connect the stories with the athletes and we have teams at every one of our major production centres, connecting those teams to our audience. There are thousands of people working across our network to deliver this sport from the venue for our production centres, and into the televisions or devices of our audience. What level of collaboration has there been internally across the business to make the most of this weekend? I would say the collaboration is one of the great outcomes of the Weekend of Champions. And we’ve seen this at its highest level when we do the Olympic Games, whether summer or winter, where our markets across Europe collaborate to ensure we’re working as one team to super-serve our audience. I think the collaboration across the different teams and the different fields of sport across every individual’s field of expertise, whether you’re cast or crew, whether your presenter or pundit, or commentator or producer or assistant – every one of these teams are working together. We began the concept of the Weekend of Champions in January, recognising that this weekend was upon us and we’ve been working tirelessly as a connected team across all of our European markets under the banner of the Weekend of Champions to make sure that we fully expose all the sports, cross-promote across all of the channels and connect with every athlete possible. Will we see much cross promotion over the course of the weekend? Our plan is to make sure that every sport interconnects with every other sports broadcast and that is not just through fairly simple picture-in-picture awareness promos – and that means that commentators are reminding you that sports are on different channels taking place either at the same time or later on that day – but right through to our talents connecting with each other live from different venues to remind people that as one sport comes to a close another sports starts. You’ll see a great collaboration between our own on-air team who are all part of the Weekend of Champions, and are all absolutely vested in making sure this weekend connects together. What are the challenges that lie ahead to ensure this weekend goes smoothly? All sport is one of the most unpredictable forms of entertainment you can possibly engage with; who knows what will unfold through all these various sports that we have in-play at the same time? So the variability is the unknown. We have spent all of our time and expertise preparing for the start of all of these sports. The unknown is what unfolds as each sport continues. And that is part of the fun. We have an amazing team, including people like Tim Henman, Mats Wilander, John McEnroe, Chris Evert at Roland-Garros, and right now they’re managing the story of tennis as it unfolds. We have an incredible team of people led by Tom Kristiansen, who is Mr Le Mans; who knows what is going to happen as 24 hours of car racing unfolds for the Le Mans 24 hours? And can Manchester City beat Inter Milan and bring it home in the Champions League? Again, football is an amazing story that unfolds over every minute of play. So we are at the behest of the competitors and the athletes from the moment they start competition.",Sports Video Group,Sports,No,3.2030283660105767,99.81390346410888,99.92453080691622,73.43604628078725,97.88488226842935,71.7497697886242,warner bros.,{},"{'president': 'senior', 'weekend': 'great', 'scale': 'sheer', 'range': 'entertaining', 'sports': 'various', 'achievements': 'individual', 'sport': 'particular', 'venues': 'different', 'racetrack': 'iconic', 'place': 'final', 'centres': 'major', 'outcomes': 'great', 'level': 'highest', 'teams': 'different', 'fields': 'different', 'team': 'incredible', 'markets': 'european', 'athlete': 'possible', 'promotion': 'much', 'broadcast': 'other', 'promos': 'simple', 'channels': 'different', 'time': 'same', 'starts': 'close', 'collaboration': 'great', 'forms': 'unpredictable', 'story': 'amazing'}",1,1

Wade last year — conservative activists have hoped that the court would repudiate many old precedents they have long disliked. On voting rights, cases such as Allen v. Milligan, which concerns Alabama’s 2022 congressional map, appeared to be potential vehicles for the court to recast the law in a sharply conservative direction. But last week, a closely divided court tempered such hopes, as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh sided with the three liberal justices in that Alabama case, upholding a core precedent on one of the country’s most important civil rights laws, the Voting Rights Act.

While Twitter-aping revivals including Bluesky, Mastodon, Post News, Hive Social, and Substack Notes have sputtered out of relevance, Threads has garnered an astonishing 48 million sign-ups within 24 hours, according to The Verge. Its rise has even prompted Twitter to send a cease-and-desist letter to the company, arguing Threads is predicated on Twitter’s trade secrets.But the rise of yet another social platform vying for users disaffected by the Elon Musk version of Twitter has forced those in media who spent the past decade cultivating their own, sometimes massive followings on the now-crumbling platform to try and rebuild those audiences from scratch.

Rendon/The Daily Beast/Cara RobbinsIn 2006, Andrew Rannells was 26, although his youthful looks made him, as he puts it, “a Broadway 18.” He had been starring in the hit musical Hairspray as Link Larkin for eight months—his first lead role on Broadway. Then one of the producers came to see him. In his just-published book of personal essays, Uncle of the Year & Other Debatable Triumphs, he recalls the producer saying, “We are not going to renew your contract next month. We are bringing in a great young guy from the national tour named Aaron Tveit. You would love him. He’s like you but younger and straight.”“The politics of any small-town community theater are ultimately the same politics you find on Broadway, and honestly any workplace,” Rannells, now 44, told The Daily Beast. “It’s the same characters everywhere. But I remember sitting there and thinking, ‘Holy shit, this is what’s happening to me right now. I’m being let go for a younger, straighter version of me?’ And, by the way, I was 26!” He laughed. “The show business is always very humbling. There are new ways every day to have your feelings hurt if you let it. People are often well-meaning but don’t know how to communicate properly. You figure out how to roll with it.“If I was faced with the same situation at 44 as I was at 27 I would speak up to that person, and say, ‘Look, I am not going to sue you. But just so you know, what you said was super offensive and probably illegal according to employment laws. So please don’t speak to me like that.’ At that age, I thought that producer was really powerful. Years later, I was working with an amazing actor, Dick Latessa, who sadly passed away in 2016. I told him about a director who had threatened to ruin my career, and that I would never work again. I was very shaken by it. Dick said that the next time I see that person, to look them in the face, and say, ‘Fuck you, there’s a lot of people I can work with.’ And he was right.”Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,No,3.656782511966994,47.49056291246393,99.98070586678952,87.44627225431647,72.60652901026351,73.98755756473712,andrew rannells,{},"{'looks': 'youthful', 'role': 'first', 'book': 'published', 'essays': 'personal', 'month': 'next', 'guy': 'young', 'tour': 'national', 'town': 'small', 'politics': 'same', 'characters': 'same', 'shit': 'holy', 'version': 'straighter', 'ways': 'new', 'situation': 'same', 'actor': 'amazing', 'time': 'next', '”read': 'more'}",1,0

Now, according to Word of Reel and confirmed on the Writers Guild of America's website, Mazin recently decided to distance himself from the project by removing his name and adopting the pseudonym Joe Crombie.This development adds to the challenges faced during the film's production, including reported reshoots with a different director. In 2022, the film underwent reshoots with Gary Ross joining as a writer for additional rewrites. After a test screening in November, Lionsgate identified the need for further work on the film, resulting in the appointment of Tim Miller as the director for additional reshoots earlier this year.Apart from Mazin, the writing team for Borderlands included Aaron Berg, Oren Uziel, Juel Taylor, Tony Rettenmaier, Zak Olkewicz, Chris Bremner, and Sam Levinson.The film features Cate Blanchett in a leading role, with principal photography concluding in 2021. Jack Black, Kevin Hart, and Jamie Lee Curtis also star.The source of these persistent issues remains unclear, whether due to studio interference or difficulties in effectively adapting the material. Nevertheless, these obstacles raise concerns about the overall quality of the movie.It's important to note that reshoots should not necessarily be seen negatively. Many successful films, including Scott Pilgrim vs. the World, Rocky, Back to the Future, and E.T. The Extra-Terrestrial all underwent reshoots to refine specific scenes.

737,Scott,2023-07-18,"""Apple Maps Gradually Winning Over Google Maps Users, Report Suggests""","iPhone users are increasingly finding reasons to choose Apple Maps over Google Maps, with some customers commending its clear public transport directions and visually appealing design. That's according to anecdotal reports collected by The Wall Street Journal (paywalled). While Apple Maps comes preinstalled on all iPhones, the overwhelming majority of iPhones in the U.S. have Google Maps downloaded as an alternative, according to Canalys. But that hasn't stopped some users becoming particularly impressed by how far Apple's transit route information has come. The app is often recommended by users for its cleaner view versus the more cluttered design of Google Maps. For example, Jane Natoli, a Google Maps ""power user"" told WSJ she finds herself using Apple Maps more in her everyday life after her iPhone prompted her to use it in the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport. The app knew she was at the airport and offered recommendations for shops and restaurants in her terminal. It had clearer information that was easier to interact with than Google Maps, said the 42-year-old. ""It made me kind of revisit and rethink some of my prior assumptions about it,"" Natoli says. ""Whatever initial reputational hurdles that Apple Maps faced, I think they've jumped over those."" Outside the airport, Natoli likes Apple's design and finds directions easier to read, especially street names. On Google Maps sometimes it's difficult to figure out the street name, no matter how closely you zoom in, she says. ""Google is showing me restaurants, bars and other things, but I'm not necessarily looking for that,"" she says.A recent graduate from Georgia Tech shared a similar sentiment. At night while driving, she said she finds that the roads are easier to look at on Apple Maps, and there are fewer points of interest cluttering her view. ""Apple's really good at making things look pretty,"" she told the outlet. Apple Maps launched in 2012 and was quickly criticized for having incomplete and inaccurate mapping data, which led some iPhone users on dangerous routes. Apple CEO Tim Cook offered a rare public apology for the frustration it caused customers, and then iOS chief Scott Forstall was ousted just one month later. Since then, Apple has made significant improvements to Apple Maps, building in new features and correcting lingering errors. Real-time traffic information and navigation options for pedestrians were added to Maps in 2013, which is also the same year Maps was extended to OS X. In 2015, Maps was updated with ""Nearby,"" a feature that offers up local points of interest and transit directions in a handful of cities. In early 2020, Apple completed a complete overhaul of its maps in the United States, featuring significantly greater detail including updated building massing, parks, sports field, pools, and more. A new Look Around feature in select cities is similar to Google's Street View, and the updated maps have been rolling out to more countries in the time since. In iOS 17, coming in the fall, users will be able to download maps for offline use in Apple Maps – something Google Maps users have been able to do now for quite some time. Praise for Apple's offering isn't by any means universal. One user told WSJ she was frequently led astray by Apple Maps as she walks around Boston, while another user said his experience with Apple Maps via CarPlay had often added time on to his commute by taking him through neighborhoods with stop signs in an effort to avoid gridlock. Apple Maps still gets a bad rap among some users, but Apple's continued efforts to improve the app appear to have helped reverse some of those opinions. ""Maps has come a long way, and people have noticed,"" Craig Federighi, Apple's head of software, said during WWDC in June. Are you more or less likely to use Apple Maps these days?

Indeed, I’m Gonna Marry You Tobey Maguire (The Cell, to July 29), directed with a delightfully off-kilter mischief by Tyler Strubble, even references Misery, that famously dripping-in-sadism movie in which Kathy Bates infamously took a sledgehammer to James Caan’s ankles after ‘rescuing’ him from a snowy car accident.But Samantha Hurley’s witty and unexpectedly moving play imagines more beyond a simple lunatic psycho torture tale—although it definitely has fun flirting with that too, and tweaking our nerves accordingly. It is set in South Dakota in 2004, where Shelby (Tessa Alberston), who is 14, has somehow managed to kidnap Maguire (Scott Thomas), and covertly transport him from Los Angeles to her home basement, where she has chained him to a pipe.Dressed up in bridal drag, her longterm intentions comingle with her devotion and delusion: he isn’t going anywhere. Janae Robinson plays both Shelby’s unseen mother, upstairs but just as may as well be in another country. Robinson is also a kind of Maguire inner voice or phantom, tormenting him as he starts inhaling large quantities of aerosols to offset the tedium and horror of his enforced captivity. Robinson is also a scene-swiping real estate agent, Brenda Dee Cankles, who alights on Shelby’s secret jail—and we all know what awaits an interloper when they intrude upon a psychopath’s despicable plans.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,No,3.0468875732810927,25.719991052844467,21.21676493023845,68.61500429291709,82.90984755519425,49.1151499077082,tobey maguire,{},"{'fan': 'crazed', 'kilter': 'off', 'movie': 'dripping', 'accident': 'snowy', 'imagines': 'witty', 'psycho': 'lunatic', 'intentions': 'longterm', 'mother': 'unseen', 'voice': 'inner', 'quantities': 'large', 'captivity': 'enforced', 'agent': 'swiping', 'estate': 'real', 'jail': 'secret', 'plans': 'despicable'}",0,1

""When I woke up this morning at 7, I was getting picked up at 7:45, Patrick, my fiancé, tried to pull me by my waist over this morning in bed,"" she said. ""And I was like, 'no baby, we don't got time for that this morning.'"" https://twitter.com/fitsnews/status/1684529711202828288?s=20 Mace went on to say that her statement may have been ""TMI,"" or too much information, before noting that she intended to sleep with her husband later that day. ""He can wait,"" she said. ""I'll see him later tonight."" While Mace's remarks earned laughter from the crowd, conservative influencers online viewed the representative’s commentary as nearing blasphemy. ""Why is (unmarried) Rep. Nancy Mace talking about her sex life at a prayer breakfast?"" one Twitter user asked. ""So. Many. Things. Wrong. With.

""She's going to criticize people for making a big 'woop' out of it... but its weird... it wasn't appropriate, we didn't need to hear it,"" another user wrote. Scott, a 2024 presidential candidate, followed up Mace's speech by highlighting America's free speech protections for topics such as religion.

Rendon/The Daily Beast/GettySensible Black Republicans were once thought to be a potential firewall for the party to prevent it from descending into MAGA paranoia, anti-woke hysteria, and conspiracy theory madness. They’ve often demonstrated an ability to look away from the action that would make Magic Johnson envious.Many of them stared in the opposite direction as the fight over “Critical Race Theory” was happening and states attempted to ban it, even from higher education. They were mostly silent as Black professors, teachers, and librarians looked for allies to help protect their academic freedoms.However, when the Florida Board of Education released its K-12 social studies curriculum, which includes an “African American History Strand,” finally some prominent Black Republicans found a voice.

Ageing is like being a pothead again’""","The Pretenders frontwoman and punk pioneer takes questions from Observer readers and famous fans on her relentless creativity spanning half a century, rethinking her hippy youth, and her cruelty-free farmChrissie Hynde has called the Pretenders’ new album – their 12th – Relentless. The name fits. Since she moved to London from Akron, Ohio exactly 50 years ago, there has always been a defiant, determined, take-on-all-comers momentum to the singer’s storied life and career. Hynde worked first at the New Musical Express in its heyday, and in Vivienne Westwood’s Kings Road shop, Sex, and so was a formative spirit in British punk, involved at the beginning with the Clash and the Sex Pistols (she almost married both John Lydon and Sid Vicious in order to obtain a work permit). The Pretenders’ eponymous first album, released in 1979, was one of the all-time great rock debuts, showcasing not only Hynde’s era-defining voice, look and attitude but also her indelible songwriting gift on tracks that included Brass in Pocket, the first new No 1 of the 1980s. Since then, like one of the band’s driving guitar lines, she has never let up.Performing a memorable set at Glastonbury in July, with friends on stage including one-time bandmate Johnny Marr of the Smiths and Dave Grohl of the Foo Fighters, Hynde’s voice, still so pure and edgy and seductive in its phrasing, transported the crowd across five decades of the Pretenders’ music, from Back on the Chain Gang and Don’t Get Me Wrong to tracks from the new album. Relentless inevitably addresses some of that inspiring longevity. “We don’t have to get fat / We don’t have to get old… We don’t have to fade to black,” Hynde sings, and, at 71, she seems living proof of that faith. She is an advocate for keeping on keeping on, as she told NME, with “no abatement of intensity. It’s the life of the artist. You never retire. You become relentless.” Continue reading...",The Guardian,Top,No,3.1853272969927646,87.2286878384964,99.84552753992756,72.88950366707766,81.585360814079,85.21521651603885,chrissie hynde,{},"{'fans': 'famous', 'creativity': 'relentless', 'youth': 'hippy', 'farmchrissie': 'free', 'album': 'new', 'relentless': '12th', 'momentum': 'defiant', 'life': 'storied', 'spirit': 'formative', 'punk': 'british', 'debuts': 'great', 'voice': 'defining', 'gift': 'songwriting', 'lines': 'driving', 'set': 'memorable', 'longevity': 'inspiring', 'proof': 'living'}",1,0

The documents, first reported by the New York Times, urged DeSantis ""to take a sledgehammer” to Vivek Ramaswamy, the Republican entrepreneur who has slowly been gaining in the polls. Dub the primary opponent ""Fake Vivek"" or ""Vivek the Fake,"" the memo advised. Ramaswamy responded to the report Thursday afternoon, who called it ""another boring, establishment attack from Super PAC-creation 'Robot Ron' who is literally taking lame, pre-programmed attack lines against me for next week’s debate."" https://twitter.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1692202661410750526 The strategy documents indicate that DeSantis' campaign may view Ramaswamy as his biggest threat at the Aug. 23 debate, given that former President Donald Trump is not expected to participate. Ramaswamy, a political newcomer, has recently been closing the gap between him and DeSantis. A RealClearPolitics polling average between July 23-Aug. 15 shows Ramaswamy in third place with 6.7%, about eight points behind DeSantis. That's a 4.3-point increase for Ramaswamy in the last two months, compared to a 5.4-point decrease for DeSantis. And Ramaswamy is polling ahead of former Vice President Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Chris Christie—all of whom had bigger name recognition coming into the race than Ramaswamy. While the debate memo also encouraged DeSantis to defend Trump in absentia from attacks wielded by Christie, Trump has celebrated DeSantis' drop in polls, referencing a recent survey by RMG Research. The polling firm holds a B- rating from FiveThirtyEight. ""It’s over for Ron DeSanctimonious, now in 3rd place. Ramaswamy now in 2nd,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday. ""RMG Research.

This court-enforced deadline comes as a result of years of tireless advocacy from communities across the country and a corresponding lawsuit filed by Earthjustice on behalf of California Communities Against Toxics, Clean Power Lake County, Rio Grande International Study Center, Sierra Club, and Union of Concerned Scientists. Initially filed in December 2022, the lawsuit challenged EPA’s failure to take legally required action to protect the public from harmful carcinogenic air emissions from ethylene oxide sterilization facilities. “Today’s consent decree signing is a critical step to ensuring that communities across the U.S. get needed protections from ethylene oxide emissions from commercial sterilizers. For years, EPA has promised new regulations to rein in commercial sterilizers’ toxic ethylene oxide emissions,” said Earthjustice Senior Attorney Marvin Brown. “And after years of missing their own deadlines, we sued and secured a judicially enforceable deadline. Now EPA must do its part and ensure that its sterilizer rule protects communities from this cancer-causing pollution.” Ethylene oxide is a colorless, typically odorless, flammable gas used to sterilize medical equipment and in the production of chemicals needed for antifreeze, plastics, detergents, and adhesives. It is one of the most toxic air pollutants EPA regulates. This toxic chemical is a known carcinogen to humans, especially when inhaled. EPA updated ethylene oxide’s toxicity value in 2016 and admits that the chemical is 60 times more toxic than previously estimated. Despite this new assessment, it has taken EPA seven years to propose new standards while countless people and their families were left vulnerable to chronic — sometimes fatal — health impacts of ethylene oxide exposure. Now, the agency must use the best-available science to enact the strongest possible protections to ensure that impacted communities will not continue to be subjected to exposure to this aggressive carcinogen. Quotes from our Clients: “As a result of the collaboration of environmental justice communities and national environmental organizations, today marks a monumental step towards cleaner air,” said Celeste Flores, Clean Power Lake County (IL) steering committee member. “We are one step closer to ensuring that the EPA finalizes the crucial commercial sterilizer rules for EtO. We urge the EPA to act swiftly and pass the strongest regulations for healthy communities.” “EPA must adopt strong, health-protective enforceable limits on ethylene oxide for our nation’s 78 sterilizers and their warehouses that include fenceline monitoring to verify those limits are being met,” stated Jane Williams of California Communities Against Toxics. “Thank goodness that we have groups like Earthjustice to fight for us so that agencies like the EPA do much more to protect communities like ours that face extremely high cancer level risks due to dangerous ethylene oxide emissions from commercial sterilizer companies like Midwest Sterilization,” said Tricia Cortez of Rio Grande International Study Center in Laredo, TX. “We need the EPA to pass the strongest rule possible, as quickly as possible.” “Families across Texas have been forced to grapple with the pervasive health and environmental impacts of ethylene oxide emissions. EPA’s harmful inaction on regulating ethylene oxide has benefitted the profits of the sterilizer industry at the expense of the health and well-being of countless families,” said Neil Carman, Sierra Club’s Lone Star Chapter’s Clean Air Program Director. “Now the clock is ticking for the agency needs to act as swiftly as possible to finalize the strongest possible protections for the environment and public health.”",Common Dreams,Top,No,3.692545227443736,99.68773328495918,93.04020259795026,88.55049076057404,70.42772820644551,75.51270202612007,decade missed,{},"{'updates': 'needed', 'deadline': 'enforceable', 'advocacy': 'tireless', 'lawsuit': 'corresponding', 'action': 'required', 'emissions': 'dangerous', 'step': 'monumental', 'protections': 'possible', 'sterilizers': 'commercial', 'regulations': 'strongest', 'deadlines': 'own', 'pollution': 'causing', 'gas': 'flammable', 'equipment': 'medical', 'pollutants': 'toxic', 'chemical': 'toxic', 'carcinogen': 'aggressive', 'oxide': 'updated', 'assessment': 'new', 'standards': 'new', 'people': 'countless', 'impacts': 'pervasive', 'science': 'available', 'communities': 'healthy', 'justice': 'environmental', 'organizations': 'environmental', 'air': 'cleaner', 'member': 'steering', 'rules': 'commercial', 'limits': 'enforceable', 'level': 'high', 'companies': 'commercial', 'rule': 'possible', 'inaction': 'harmful', 'families': 'countless', 'health': 'public'}",0,0

The department plans to hold the sale Sept. 27. Lease Sale 261, which the Biden administration canceled in 2021, is the last of three offshore oil and gas lease sales mandated under the Inflation Reduction Act. Lease Sales 258 and 259, held in December 2022 and March 2023, were also revived by the IRA. Those lease sales were challenged in federal court for failing to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act.Today’s lawsuit challenges the upcoming lease sale for violating NEPA because Interior did not consider the health threats to Gulf Coast communities living near oil refineries and other polluting drilling infrastructure. The department also failed to adequately consider the climate harm from this massive new source of fossil fuel production. The lease sale could result in the production of more than 1 billion barrels of oil and 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over the next 50 years, resulting in more than 370 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions.The department agreed to limit the leasing area to reduce the risk of driving the endangered Rice’s whale to extinction. Scientists estimate there may be only 51 Rice’s whales left on Earth.The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the District of Columbia on behalf of Healthy Gulf, Bayou City Waterkeeper, Friends of the Earth, Center for Biological Diversity, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Sierra Club.In September, Interior is expected to release its final proposed five-year program for offshore oil and gas leasing. The plan, which lasts through 2028, could include as many as 11 new offshore lease sales. Holding 11 new fossil fuel auctions would sanction up to 70 years of additional fossil-fuel extraction with the potential to emit up to 3.5 billion tons of carbon pollution.Statements from Earthjustice, its clients and partners:“Once again, the Biden administration has fallen short of the federal law by neglecting to consider the impact of this massive oil sale on Gulf communities and the climate,” said Earthjustice attorney George Torgun. “We’re pleased that Interior excluded habitat for the nearly extinct Gulf of Mexico whale from this lease sale, but it’s equally critical that Interior builds on this step and protects climate and Gulf communities from the harms of leasing.”“Unfortunately, given BOEM’s history of sacrificing the Gulf of Mexico to Big Oil, this lease sale decision comes as no surprise,” said Hallie Templeton, legal director of Friends of the Earth. “Our lawsuit should also come as no surprise, since BOEM continues to rely on the same outdated, broken environmental analysis. If we are going to make a dent in the climate crisis, business as usual must stop. We are going to keep fighting until the Gulf of Mexico is off the table for good.”“As steward of the country’s public lands and waters, Interior has a duty to fully consider the harms offshore leasing can cause, from air pollution to oil spills, and beyond,” said Julia Forgie, attorney for NRDC (the Natural Resources Defense Council). “This vast lease sale — for millions of acres — poses threats to Gulf communities and endangered species while contributing to the climate crisis this region knows far too well. We are holding the agency to its obligation to carefully assess these risks and the climate fallout of this giveaway to Big Oil.”“It’s mind-boggling that in this summer of deadly fossil fuel-driven record heat, fires and flooding the Biden administration couldn’t be bothered to look carefully at the damage this lease sale will cause to people, endangered wildlife and the climate,” said Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Across the country we’re seeing lethal wildfires, boiling ocean temperatures and mass coral die-offs, all caused or exacerbated by a climate unnaturally warmed by fossil fuel emissions. We’ve got to stop letting oil and gas companies make it worse by drilling in our oceans.”“It is time to transition away from fossil fuels,” said Kristen Schlemmer, legal director and waterkeeper for Bayou City Waterkeeper. “Continued development in the Gulf of Mexico creates unfair burdens on communities in Houston and across the Gulf South. Moving forward with Lease Sale 261 means more drilling in the years to come. It means more facilities in our backyards. It means higher rates of cancer and heart and lung diseases, and it means more risks during major storms.”“Selling public lands and waters to Big Polluters is incompatible with achieving the ambitious climate goals the Biden Administration itself has set,” said Devorah Ancel, Sierra Club Environmental Law Program senior attorney. “Fossil fuel extraction is destructive to communities, ecosystems, wildlife, and our climate. The devastating effects of climate change, from heat waves to storms, are particularly harmful to frontline communities, as this summer has shown. Moving forward with this lease sale locks us into extraction for decades to come, right as we should be transitioning to clean energy.”",Common Dreams,Top,No,3.692545227443736,95.68797738514483,99.6901835008178,88.55049076057404,70.42772820644551,75.51270202612007,lawsuit massive,{},"{'groups': 'environmental', 'sale': 'vast', 'sales': 'new', 'court': 'federal', 'infrastructure': 'polluting', 'source': 'new', 'feet': 'cubic', 'gas': 'natural', 'years': 'next', 'program': 'proposed', 'leasing': 'offshore', 'lease': 'offshore', 'auctions': 'new', 'extraction': 'additional', 'fuel': 'fossil', 'law': 'federal', 'director': 'legal', 'analysis': 'environmental', 'lands': 'public', 'species': 'endangered', 'heat': 'driven', 'wildlife': 'endangered', 'wildfires': 'lethal', 'fuels': 'fossil', 'development': 'continued', 'burdens': 'unfair', 'drilling': 'more', 'facilities': 'more', 'rates': 'higher', 'risks': 'more', 'storms': 'major', 'goals': 'ambitious', 'attorney': 'senior', 'effects': 'devastating'}",0,0

The letter calls on symposium participants to act quickly and vigorously to address recent escalations in climate-related financial risks. In remarks this morning, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell omitted any mention of climate-related financial risks in his Jackson Hole speech. The open letter notes that climate change impacts are outpacing authorities’ current efforts to address climate change financial risks. This is evidenced by escalating costs of physical risks and growing gaps in insurance coverage, among other things. Policy makers, especially in the banking and insurance sectors, must: Adopt a precautionary approach to risk mitigation, given climate change’s tipping points and unpredictable tail risks. This could include capital adjustments and other mechanisms to properly reflect the risk of fossil fuel production and thus facilitate a transition;Design capital buffers that specifically take into account the systemic risks of climate change;Require the use of forward-looking tools, such as transition plans, which can help both authorities and market participants better understand and mitigate their own climate-related transition risks, as well as improve understanding of aggregated, systemic risks and promote accountability. Elizabeth Jacobs, a Sustainable Finance Specialist at E3G said: “Jackson Hole is a unique setting, and not only for its natural beauty. At the 2005 Jackson Hole Symposium, warnings about risks building up in the financial system were minimized. Within the next 5 years, the Global Financial Crisis ensued, and policy makers were promptly consumed with giving themselves new authorities designed to avert future crises. Using precautionary approaches and transition plans can help avoid a ruinous rinse, wash, repeat cycle.”Alex Martin, Climate Finance Policy Director at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund said: “Financial regulators have put in increasing effort in recent years to try to understand and better manage climate risk, but unfortunately, climate change is vastly outpacing their progress. Precious little time remains to get ahead of the risk as insurers flee vulnerable areas and banks respond in kind. Resigning ourselves to merely picking up the pieces after climate-driven financial disruptions and crises unfold—which is where we are headed—is utterly unacceptable. Regulators must double down now.""David Arkush, director of Public Citizen’s Climate Program, said: “It is shocking that this symposium, which purports to address structural shifts in the global economy, does not include a single agenda item on the climate crisis or climate solutions — some of the most important drivers of change in the global economy and most significant sources of risk to global financial stability. Rather than stand by as the next global financial crisis develops, the top officials and economists at this conference should be actively considering responses and solutions. And the officials should adopt assertive policies that shepherd the economy and financial system swiftly and safely through the tumultuous climate-related transitions that are already underway.”Jackie Fielder, co-director of Stop the Money Pipeline coalition said: “Any symposium entitled ‘Structural Shifts in the Global Economy’ without a single mention of climate disasters and the billions they have cost everyday people and local economies, should concern every American with a pension who agrees that climate change is here.”Akiksha Chatterji, lead campaigner at Positive Money US said: ""Regulators are failing to act at the scale or pace necessary to curb the significant financial stability threats arising from climate change and fossil fuel financing. Rest assured, climate risks will materialise and we simply cannot quantify the precise nature and timing of these impacts as they are complex and ever changing. Emergency measures taken after a climate-driven financial crash may not suffice to contain such a meltdown. It’s time for the regulators and officials at this symposium to adopt a precautionary approach to climate and do their jobs before another financial crisis ensues.""",Common Dreams,Top,No,3.692545227443736,50.79056096587243,90.95425129390684,88.55049076057404,70.42772820644551,75.51270202612007,climate summer,{},"{'organizations': 'international', 'letter': 'open', 'bankers': 'central', 'escalations': 'recent', 'risks': 'systemic', 'efforts': 'current', 'gaps': 'growing', 'things': 'other', 'approach': 'precautionary', 'mechanisms': 'other', 'buffers': 'transition;design', 'tools': 'looking', 'setting': 'unique', 'beauty': 'natural', 'system': 'financial', 'years': 'recent', 'authorities': 'new', 'crises': 'future', 'approaches': 'precautionary', 'rinse': 'ruinous', 'regulators': 'financial', 'effort': 'increasing', 'time': 'little', 'areas': 'vulnerable', 'disruptions': 'financial', 'shifts': 'structural', 'economy': 'global', 'item': 'single', 'drivers': 'important', 'sources': 'significant', 'stability': 'financial', 'crisis': 'financial', 'officials': 'top', 'policies': 'assertive', 'transitions': 'related', 'mention': 'single', 'people': 'everyday', 'economies': 'local', 'pace': 'necessary', 'threats': 'significant', 'nature': 'precise', 'crash': 'financial'}",0,0

Soros! Hunter! abortion up to birth! Trans Marxists in bathrooms! - as sorry also-rans in a bleakly unpresidential race to the bottom. For Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, today's GOP evokes T.S. Eliot’s The Hollow Men: “This is the way the world ends/Not with a bang but a whimper.” Trump, of course, skipped the Fox-aired ""debate"" between clowns and thugs to witlessly blather with Tucker Carlson, who a few months ago declared of the multi-indicted former etc, ""I hate him passionately""; still, they gamely rambled through the vital issues of the day: the possible murder of Jeffrey Epstein - ""I will say he was a fixture in Palm Beach"" - by Bill Barr; ""the Left"" as ""savage animals...really sick""; the deep state plot to limit water in washing machines; Jan. 6 rioters behaving ""peacefully and patriotically."" Many chose not to watch either Trump or his fellow-cretins; explained one patriot, ""I was too busy working on my 'Mugshots of Treason' collectible trading cards."" For those unfortunates who ventured forth to bear witness to two hours of fascist-flavored gas-lighting, fear-mongering, ""substanceless statements"" and ""gelatinous ideas"" cheered on by an audience of gullible, complicit yahoos, they beheld a toxic yet vacant party that ""has become meaner, dumber, and wholly divorced from the issues Americans actually care about."" It was, argued Peter Birkenhead, like ""watching cancer cells debate health.""The event seemed even more bizarre in light of the next day's arrest of the felon who leads them all by an incomprehensible mile. Reflecting the warped, alternate reality in which their party now resides, candidates gamely pretended there was some actual reason for them to be lumbering through a contest both ""chaotic and boring,"" devoid of ideas or principles but steeped in belligerent buzzwords and ""word-salad recitation of right-wing talking points""; even so, they largely rallied the domestic terrorist troops only at ominous nods to China, Mexico, Soros, teachers' unions and other fictional seeds of their discontent. Even there in placid, mid-Western Milwaukee, the thematic darkness was clear from an incendiary opening montage of protesters, immigrants, burning cities, rampaging crime, all the evils Trump raged about in his famously deranged inaugural vow, “This American carnage stops right here and right now” - which George Bush later dubbed ""some weird shit."" Yes, but still weirdly persisting. ""Republican debates once were celebrations of American greatness,"" notes Eugene Robinson. ""Now, they are wallows in American grievance.""Thus did all eight candidates, voicing the affronted victimhood of today's right wing, labor to portray ""the wealthiest, most powerful country on Earth as some kind of hellish dystopia."" They feverishly cited civic mayhem, urban rubble, the imaginary threats of immigrant hordes, Marxist mobs, CRT and swimming trans kids and abortion ""all the way up to the moment of birth"" (which doesn't exist) while - irony alert - universally rejecting climate change, the one real danger confronting us, as ""a hoax."" ""It is not morning in America - we live in a dark moment,” declaimed businessman, loudmouth and wannabe demagogue Vivek Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old, wildly uninformed political novice who insisted, ""We're in the middle of a national identity crisis,"" maybe thanks to a presidential contender in such moronic denial of climate change he shrilly promises to ""drill, frack, burn coal, embrace nuclear"" while claiming ""more people are dying of bad climate change policies than (of) actual climate change."" More of his red-meat nuggets of wisdom: The nuclear family is ""the greatest form of governance known to mankind,"" the ""only war I will declare as President will be the war on the federal administrative state!” and, straight-faced, ""Trump is the best president of the 21st century.""Along with brazenly, incongruously stealing Obama lines - ""Who the heck is this skinny guy with a funny last name?"" he suggested the audience was thinking - Ramaswamy proved the ""weirdest guy on stage,"" surpassing even weird DeSantis, in his garish performance as a ""Trumpier than Trump"" huckster who, like ""your annoying college roommate,"" eagerly jumps into every exchange despite having no idea what he's talking about. Hence, some barbed exchanges: To his claim we shouldn't support Ukraine, Nikki Haley snapped, “You are choosing a murderer over a pro-American country. You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows."" Bizarrely, it was Ramaswamy who led the cheer-leading charge for Trump - while ostensibly running against him - after co-moderator Bret Baier announced ""a brief moment (to) talk about the elephant not in the room."" When Baier asked the motley assemblage who'd still support for ""president"" the thug facing 91 felony charges if he's convicted, Ramaswamy's hand shot up, followed by Tim Scott, Doug Burgum and Haley; excruciatingly, they were slowly joined by a sheepish Pence though Trump tried to get him hung, and shamefaced profile in courage DeSantis after he looked to see what everyone else did. The crowd cheered.DeSantis was widely deemed the evening's biggest loser, alternately angry, evasive, rictus-grimacing, stiffly canned - ""Send Joe Biden back to his basement!"" - and wooden even when issuing murderous edicts on migrants: ""We're going (to) leave them stone-cold dead."" He often appeared notably clueless: Asked, ""How would you fix the American economy?"", he responded, ""You bring Anthony Fauci (now a retired doctor) into the Oval Office (and) you say, ‘ANTHONY YOU ARE FIRED!’” Umm. He also trashed Hunter Biden's ""lousy paintings,"" criticized ""lockdowns"" that don't exist, crudely bragged about the evils he's inflicted on Florida, dodged a question on a national abortion ban but said he loved his kids' sonograms and wants ""a culture of life,"" told a freakish, bogus story - ""I know a lady in Florida"" though it was Michigan - about a woman born alive in 1955 after a botched abortion, threw in a quick anti-Semitic jab at ""George-Soros backed"" prosecutors ""victimizing innocent people,"" and oddly declined to use his fave term ""woke"" (Nikki Halley did once with ""crazy, woke things"" in schools) though he's proudly, ceaselessly proclaimed ad nauseum, ""Florida is where woke goes to die."" Huh. Now it seems Milwaukee is where it, and he, will meet their welcome, unseemly end.Sadly but predictably, the other incoherent also-rans didn't fare any better. Asked about crime, Tim Scott said the first thing he'd do is fire Merrick Garland; he also often said ""single-parent household"" and ""God’s green Earth."" Asked about the economy, Mike Pence boasted he and Trump added three zealots to the Supreme Court; he also reminded an audience of mindless, bloodthirsty, GOP nihilists he ""upheld the Constitution"" but didn't admit, per Chris Hayes, it was 'cause he ""didn't want to be another guy with a mugshot."" Nikki Haley thought there might be climate change but still China, China, China, also India. Nobody mentioned gun violence that's now the leading killer of kids in America, though this weekend saw another shooting, in DeSantis' assault-rifle-filled Florida, with ""mass fatalities."" All told, the ""debate"" laid bare a party ""unmoored from reality,"" bereft of ideas, values or policies and filling the vacuum with culture wars, racist tropes, ugly scapegoating. It struck Roy Edroso, who ""watched as much as I could,"" as ""something out of a neurological experiment,"" clearly not benign. He saw a cheap ""trunk show...loud, fast, and out of control,"" with no winners: ""Nobody...not even the screamers, expects to see a president come out of this.""Many concurred on a malignant shipwreck of a party hollowed out and stripped down to its meanest, rankest parts by a two-bit grifter - now hawking ""Never Surrender"" mugs and t-shirts marking his 4th surrender - who's left behind the ragged survivors to sink or less-than-convincingly swim. For fans of Succession, the debate's shabby specimens evoked Logan Roy's searing, mournful appraisal of his dysfunctional offspring: ""You are not serious people."" Noticeably escaping unscathed from the GOP debacle was Joe Biden, who happily embraced his no-malarkey alter-ego Dark Brandon, complete with laser-shooting eyes, in some strong messaging on Fox and around Milwaukee. Billboards featuring Biden/Brandon brashly declared, ""Social Security Cuts? Try Me"" and ""Get Real Jack. I'm Bringing Roe Back."" Biden was also on X, the dumb new name for Twitter, snarking away. To the inane claim climate change is ""a hoax,"" he retorted, “Climate change is real, by the way”; to Haley's admission that Trump added $8 billion to the national debt, he wrote, ""What she said."" And when the whole mess mercifully ended, he added a common-sense, real-world adage from his father. ""You know, my dad used to say, 'Don't compare me to the Almighty,'"" he wrote. ""'Compare me to the alternative.""",Common Dreams,Top,Yes,3.5519630832951266,64.56144189167613,99.9655069611107,84.20984147964285,72.54048002746494,92.76572413337796,hollow men,{},"{'spectacle': 'surreal', 'cranks': 'tawdry', 'pygmies': 'political', 'rans': 'sorry', 'race': 'unpresidential', 'debate': 'aired', 'months': 'few', 'issues': 'vital', 'murder': 'possible', 'animals': 'savage', 'plot': 'deep', 'cards': 'collectible', 'statements': 'substanceless', 'ideas': 'gelatinous', 'yahoos': 'gullible', 'party': 'unmoored', 'day': 'next', 'mile': 'incomprehensible', 'reality': 'alternate', 'reason': 'actual', 'contest': 'chaotic', 'buzzwords': 'belligerent', 'recitation': 'salad', 'wing': 'right', 'points': 'wing', 'troops': 'terrorist', 'nods': 'ominous', 'seeds': 'fictional', 'darkness': 'thematic', 'montage': 'incendiary', 'cities': 'burning', 'vow': 'inaugural', 'carnage': 'american', 'shit': 'weird', 'debates': 'republican', 'greatness': 'american', 'grievance': 'american', 'victimhood': 'affronted', 'country': 'american', 'dystopia': 'hellish', 'mayhem': 'civic', 'rubble': 'urban', 'threats': 'imaginary', 'mobs': 'marxist', 'danger': 'real', 'moment': 'brief', 'businessman': 'declaimed', 'novice': 'political', 'crisis': 'national', 'contender': 'presidential', 'denial': 'moronic', 'coal': 'burn', 'people': 'serious', 'policies': 'bad', 'change': 'actual', 'meat': 'red', 'family': 'nuclear', 'form': 'greatest', 'war': 'only', 'state': 'administrative', 'president': 'best', 'century': '21st', 'guy': 'weirdest', 'name': 'new', 'performance': 'garish', 'roommate': 'annoying', 'exchanges': 'barbed', 'policy': 'foreign', 'charge': 'leading', 'loser': 'angry', 'edicts': 'murderous', 'economy': 'american', 'doctor': 'retired', 'paintings': 'lousy', 'ban': 'national', 'story': 'bogus', 'abortion': 'botched', 'jab': 'semitic', 'term': 'fave', 'nauseum': 'proclaimed', 'end': 'unseemly', 'thing': 'first', 'parent': 'single', 'nihilists': 'bloodthirsty', 'killer': 'leading', 'fatalities': 'mass', 'tropes': 'racist', 'experiment': 'neurological', 'show': 'loud', 'shipwreck': 'malignant', 'parts': 'rankest', 'surrender': '4th', 'survivors': 'ragged', 'specimens': 'shabby', 'appraisal': 'mournful', 'offspring': 'dysfunctional', 'eyes': 'shooting', 'messaging': 'strong', 'claim': 'inane', 'debt': 'national', 'mess': 'whole', 'sense': 'common', 'world': 'real'}",1,0
