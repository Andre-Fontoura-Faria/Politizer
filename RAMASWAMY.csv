15,Ramaswamy,2023-03-21,"""DeSantis Privately Called for Google to Be “Broken Up”""","by Andy Kroll, ProPublica, and Nick Surgey, Documented ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. Florida governor Ron DeSantis has frequently railed against “Big Tech.” He has accused Google, Facebook and Twitter of silencing conservative voices. But in private, DeSantis has gone even further. In previously unreported comments made in 2021, DeSantis said technology companies like Google “should be broken up” by the U.S. government. DeSantis, widely considered a presidential hopeful, made the remarks at an invite-only retreat for the Teneo Network, a “private and confidential” group for elite conservatives. ProPublica and Documented obtained video of the event. “They’re just too big, they have too much power,” DeSantis said. “I think they’re exercising a more negative influence on our society than the trusts that got broken up at the early 20th century.” He added that large tech companies “are ruining our country. They’re a very negative influence. And so I think you need to be strong about it.” DeSantis’ call to break up large tech companies occurred at the Teneo Network’s annual retreat in 2021. As ProPublica and Documented recently reported, the Teneo Network aims to “crush liberal dominance” across many areas of American society, according to its chairman Leonard Leo, the influential legal activist and longtime leader of the Federalist Society. DeSantis’ office did not respond to requests seeking comment. Teneo declined to comment. In recent years, “Big Tech” has emerged as a favored target for Republican lawmakers and activists, even as prominent conservatives have amassed huge followings on Twitter, Facebook and other platforms. Pointing to such high-profile examples as Donald Trump’s suspension from Facebook and Twitter’s decision to briefly block a story about Hunter Biden’s laptop, Republicans claim that U.S. tech companies have systematically suppressed conservative viewpoints and interfered with elections in ways that have helped Democrats. A 2021 study issued by New York University researchers concluded those assertions were baseless. “The claim of anti-conservative animus on the part of social media companies is itself a form of disinformation: a falsehood with no reliable evidence to support it,"" the researchers for the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights wrote. Liberal lawmakers and policy experts have also called for stronger antitrust enforcement of major tech companies. During the 2020 presidential race, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., campaigned on a platform of breaking up Amazon, Facebook and Google, saying they had “too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.” In 2021, Democrats in Congress introduced legislation to split up tech firms, but the bills never became law. Matt Stoller, an antitrust expert who works at the American Economic Liberties Project, said it’s hard to tell if DeSantis’ private comments indicate genuine concern about corporate concentration of power or just anger at large firms perceived to be hostile to conservatives. “There’s a war on the right about antitrust,” Stoller said. “I’m skeptical but open-minded that DeSantis wants to do something serious about economic power.” Stoller added that he was more intrigued by DeSantis’ decision to call for breaking up tech at an event so closely associated with Leonard Leo. “If Leo buys that argument,” Stoller said, “then it means that a lot of federal judges might tip in that direction, too.” A spokesperson for Leo declined to comment. Teneo’s retreats are invite-only affairs limited to its members, their spouses and special guests. ProPublica and Documented obtained a video of DeSantis’ remarks about big tech, which took place during a longer conversation between DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur who is now running for president as a Republican. Watch Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Talk About Breaking Up Big Tech (Teneo) Watch video ➜ As governor, DeSantis has repeatedly singled out tech and social-media companies, saying their actions “may be one of the most pervasive threats to American self-government in the 21st century.” Legislation he signed in May 2021 not only seeks to give Floridians the ability to sue tech companies and win monetary damages, it also empowers the state’s attorney general to bring cases against tech companies under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. (Tech companies are challenging the law, and its fate remains unclear.) In February of this year, DeSantis introduced a plan to create what he called a Digital Bill of Rights for Florida citizens. The proposal, billed as a way to protect privacy and eliminate “unfair censorship,” would ban TikTok on state government devices and block local and state employees “from coordinating with Big Tech companies to censor protected speech.” But unlike some of his fellow conservatives, DeSantis’ barbed public remarks about big tech have stopped short of urging the U.S. government to break up those tech companies. In his new book, “The Courage to Be Free,” he makes only a passing reference to “enforcing antitrust laws” against “large corporations that are wielding what is effectively public power.” In his remarks at the Teneo Network retreat, DeSantis described tech companies as “monopolies” that “have more power over our lives than the monopolies of the early 20th century ever had. And it’s not even close.” He listed tech companies’ extensive data collection practices and their ability to shape “core political speech” as evidence of big tech’s monopolistic powers. (Teneo) Watch video ➜ He went on to say that tech platforms “enforce their terms unevenly,” adding that “if you have a conservative viewpoint, you’re much more likely to get censored, you’re much more likely to get deplatformed.” And in response to critics who might say it’s not the role of government at any level to insert itself into the workings of a private business, DeSantis offered a sharp rebuttal. “Protecting the rights of folks to participate in political speech, I think, is an absolutely appropriate role of government,” he said. “And I think that we should do all that we can.” When pressed by Ramaswamy onstage about using government power to shrink big tech companies, DeSantis stood by his position. “Those big companies are basically an arm of the ruling regime,” he said. “Yeah, that should be something that should be done.” And when asked if he feared that breaking up U.S. companies would strengthen China’s position in global markets, DeSantis appeared unbothered, saying that he believed antitrust action was still the correct course. “These tech companies are ruining our country,” he said. “They’re a very negative influence. You need to be strong about it. And so that would not be the biggest concern I would have. My concern would be not having massive concentrations of power that are capable of silencing dissent, enforcing an orthodoxy and obviously interfering in elections, which we saw they did in 2020.” Do you have information about Leonard Leo or the Teneo Network that we should know?

I'm convinced that people want leaders that appeal to the best of America, and not simply appeal to our worst instincts.""Hutchinson said following news of Trump's indictment at the hands of a Manhattan grand jury that the former president should drop out of the 2024 race, a position he reiterated in his ABC interview.""For the sake of the office of the presidency, I do think that's too much of a sideshow and distraction,"" said Hutchinson, who in 2016 described Trump as ""exactly the kind of transparent, straight-talking leader America needs.""As governor of Arkansas, Hutchinson signed into law a near-total abortion ban and—with permission from the Trump administration—made his state the first to impose work requirements on Medicaid recipients, a move that kicked more than 18,000 people off the program.

44,Ramaswamy,2023-04-18,"""Loyal Friends of the NRA Vow to Save Our Guns and Fridges""","Celebrating a ""freedom-filled weekend,"" gun freaks just flocked to another NRA confab - Wall of Guns! Rifles for Two-Year-Olds! Defend Against Radical Lunatics! - to champion their sacred right to add to our bloody carnage. Among a swarm of GOP pols, the Orange Nazi memorably decried yuge gangs of ""communist maniacs"" attacking ""apartment stores"" and carting off refrigerators, air conditioners, ""fur coats, not fur coats, everything."" No wonder they wanna vote for him.The weekend's three-day NRA convention, held in Indianapolis, featured the usual delights: National Prayer Breakfast, Youth Day, much merch - I Am the NRA t-shirts, Don't Tread On Me mugs, NRA: I Am Freedom stickers - and acres of exhibits: Humvees, AR-15 Build Kits ($299), shiny new guns like Colt's bolt-action TacHunter, mini-compact handguns, aluminum M1911-style handguns with 11-round flush-fit magazine capacity, 2023's Gun of the Year Springfield Armory SA-35 9mm with NRA Grips. Because, for retailers, ""NRA members are your best customers! Can you afford to not be here?"" Distressingly, there were also many, many, sweet Jesus too many small children wistfully fingering large guns. Outside the convention, protesters took turns reading the names of the roughly 1,600 American kids killed by guns last year. Organizer Mary Tuttle noted that Indiana lawmakers just passed a bill banning gender-affirming care for minors but declined to act on gun violence, though, ""Zero children have died from puberty blockers. Not one."" Given that, in part thanks to NRA lobbying, Americans have stockpiled over 400 million guns - more weaponry than the Armed Forces, Dept. of Homeland Security, and local police agencies combined - attendees were also greeted by a billboard by Mad Dog PAC reading, ""The NRA Is A Terrorist Organization.""The convention, its stage emblazoned with ""Defend Your Freedom,"" came days after mass shootings at a Nashville school and a Louisville bank, and on the second anniversary of a mass shooting at an Indianapolis FedEx that killed nine people; last year's ever-fearless NRA held their convention days after the school massacre in Uvalde, Texas. Thoughts and prayers all around; the show must go on. Still, NRA organizers boasted the convention was ""the safest place in the USA to be today"" because - WTF - guns were banned as too dangerous. Thus did GOP Presidential hopefuls comfortably, dutifully assemble to kiss the blood-spattered ring of beleaguered NRA CEO, ghoul and thug Wayne LaPierre, who warned, “Gun-hating politicians should never go to bed unafraid of what this association, and all of our millions of members, can do to their political careers."" Some pols phoned it in: Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Ron DeathSantis, who fresh from his pudding bragged that, even after the slaughter of 17 innocents at Parkland, he's ""resisted calls to take up gun control even when such a stand is superficially unpopular,” as though Floridians are only superficially opposed to being gunned down in America's usual killing fields - schools, malls, synagogues, grocery stores etc. He also ran an ad trashing Trump for evidently once suggesting - horrors - maybe the killing should stop.In person, a long list of mostly unknown speakers echoed him; those with higher profiles battled to go ever lower. Asa Hutchinson warned ""Joe Biden and the gun-control extremists (to) give up your pipe-dreams of gun compensation in this free society. Stop endangering our lives with gun bans and stop tramping on the rights of the American people every time tragedy happens."" Vivek Ramaswamy called for more firepower and less CRT in schools, and shutting down the FBI/ATF: ""What does the AR-15 stand for? It stands for freedom."" New Hampshire's Chris Sununu mocked Biden, bragged he vetoed a gun law - cheers - and told the feds to ""shove it."" Mike Pence got booed in his own state - ""I love you too"" - urged more armed guards, sent prayers to the latest dead kids. South Dakota's newly big-lipped, hair-extensioned Gov. Kristi Noem won cheers when she declared ""I am the NRA"" to prove it's not just old white guys - cameraman pans to audience of old white guys; ominously intoned, ""Liberals and Joe Biden want our guns because it will make it easier for them to infringe on all our other rights""; proposed after massacres, ""families gathered together (and) prayed for wisdom and discernment on how to heal hearts and minds""; and eerily boasted her 2-year-old granddaughter ""already owns a shotgun and rifle and soon will need them."" (Twitter: ""And my dog has three books and a calculator."")But Trump, “the most pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment president,” took the gun-nuttery cake, vowing, “I will be your loyal friend and fearless champion,"" like during ""the China virus"" when ""I proudly designated gun dealers as critical infrastructure."" Before the Die-Hard revenge fantasies, he made bombastic claims about his ""epic struggle"" against Dems who ""want to take away your guns while throwing open jailhouse doors and releasing bloodthirsty criminals...to abolish your borders and impoverish your families...to demonize patriots and persecute Christians while pushing the transgender cult.” Whew. It was then he went on his ""refrigerator-theft blast"" about ""these gangs of hundreds of young people (who) go and attack an apartment... department stores"" (in Dem-run cities) and ""they’re running out carrying refrigerators (and) air conditioners and big stuff. Big, little, everything. Fur coats, not fur coats, everything...They empty out the stores."" And then the police are ""standing there, they're shaking, they want to do their job, but they're not allowed to do their job because of these radical lunatics,"" even though they won't admit most violent crime is ""committed by a brutal class of hardened repeat criminals. That’s who’s doing it. In San Francisco..."" Also, tents in D.C. - ""I had to take them down immediately"" - and ""incredible monuments"" and ""beautiful lawns"" and ""the only one they want to prosecute is Donald Trump, let's get him, it's unbelievable."" Yes. It is. This evil, inept, barking mad clown - who says our mass slaughter ""is not a gun problem"" but a spiritual problem maybe abetted by ""genetically engineered cannabis"" - is the leading GOP candidate for president. Twitter had thoughts: ""Seems totally real. In fact, many people strongly say they see people running with 300-lb refrigerators strapped on their backs while wearing fur coats...They don't even put the fridges under their coats like the old days...They're taking gas stoves too just in case...With tears in their eyes?...Never mind the diamonds and tablets - grab that fridge!...They’re taking the refrigerators 'cause there isn’t strong enough water pressure when they flush the toilets on account of the birds being killed by windmills...I have seen peoople, thugs if you will, carrying 1 fish, even 2 fish, I even saw them with a red fish and a blue fish, just lawlessness everywhere...Since I'm anti-fur, I would suggest the looters stick with 'non-fur' coats. Also, Sub Zero is the fridge you want...They grab 16-ton weights, moons, Mjollnir, everything. Sometimes they just pick up the store and run with it!...And they take things that happened, that didn’t happen, we'll take that for $500...And by the way, they’re coming for you: the liberals, the Blacks, the Jews. The drag queens want to steal your children. Have you bought a gun today?"" All the while, in a broken country where many hateful, lost, white, straight men ""stand back and stand by,"" hungry for control - ""Strength. Boots, smashing faces...My rifle is my best friend - without it I am useless"" - the shooting and killing goes on and on. America's most lethal weekend so far this year, Feb. 17 through Feb. 19, saw 10 mass shootings of over 50 victims: Nine children shot at a Georgia gas station, six people killed in a Mississippi town, eleven people shot in Memphis, five people shot in New Orleans, six people shot on a Chicago expressway. This last week has been almost as bloody. Thursday night, 16-year-old Ralph Yarl was shot in the head in Kansas City for knocking on a neighbor's door while black; miraculously, he survived, and prosecutors Monday night charged an 85-year-old white man with first-degree assault and armed criminal action. This weekend, with the NRA's obscenity underway, 38 people were shot, eight fatally, in gun violence across Chicago. Also this weekend, days after the Louisville bank shooting that killed four, a mass shooting at a sweet 16 birthday party in Alabama killed four and injured 32; a shooting at a crowded Chickasaw Park in Louisville left two dead and four injured. On Saturday, Mayor Craig Greenberg responded to the bloodshed with, ""This is not who we are."" Really? Lookit these kids at the NRA fest.

51,Ramaswamy,2023-04-21,"""The Right Embraces Shareholder Activism in War on So-Called ""Woke"" Capitalism""","After years of criticizing progressives for shareholder activism focused on social justice and environmental concerns, right-wing groups and ideologues are embracing the same strategy themselves. At publicly held companies, right-wing shareholder proposals that target environmental, social, and governance (ESG) frameworks are up 60% compared to this time last year, according to the 2023 Proxy Preview report published by the nonprofits As You Sow, the Sustainable Investments Institute, and Proxy Impact. Of the hundreds of shareholder resolutions that have been filed so far in 2023, the report identifies 43 proposals that decry corporate attempts to redress climate inaction, racial inequity, abortion restrictions, and gun violence. Additional anti-ESG proposals are likely to be filed in advance of annual shareholder meetings, which usually take place in May. Most of the proposals come from groups that are key players in the Right's war on ""woke"" capitalism. Groups Leading the Charge The National Center for Public Policy Research (NCPPR), a right-wing advocacy group, has filed at least 17 anti-ESG proposals with various corporations this year, the most of any conservative organization profiled in the report. NCPPR has spearheaded a campaign it calls Stop Corporate Tyranny, which rails against ""cancel culture"" and accuses corporations of both allowing themselves to be weaponized against ""traditional American values"" and silencing conservative perspectives in adopting ""the progressive Left's extreme and radical agenda."" Quoting Fox News host Tucker Carlson, NCPPR claims that ""the biggest threat to liberty is no longer big government, its [sic] big business."" NCPPR claims that ""the biggest threat to liberty is no longer big government, its [sic] big business."" The campaign is part of NCPPR's Back to Neutral Coalition, which includes the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), the right-wing corporate bill mill that works with state lawmakers across the country to enact pro-corporate legislation. ALEC chief executive Lisa Nelson is a member of the NCPPR board. The National Legal and Policy Center (NLPC), another major anti-woke culture warrior, has filed the second most anti-ESG shareholder proposals this year. A former associate member of the State Policy Network (SPN), a right-wing coalition of free market think tanks, the so-called ""watchdog"" group has received funding from major right-wing donors, including the Sarah Scaife Foundation. The majority of NLPC's proposals are concerned with ""ties to Communist China"" and have been filed with large multinational corporations such as Starbucks, McDonald's, Merck, General Motors, Boeing, and Apple. A different resolution targeted at Meta, the parent company of Facebook, demands a report on ""government censorship."" Climate Change Corporate policies that attempt to curb fossil fuel use and address the climate crisis have long raised the ire of right-wing groups—many of which receive major funding from the oil and gas industry. NLPC filed memos with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) urging shareholders at Bank of America, Citigroup, Goldman Sachs, and Wells Fargo to vote against proposals asking the banks ""to take additional actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions."" Shareholder meetings for all four financial institutions are being held next week. Steven Milloy, a former Fox News columnist and lobbyist for the tobacco and fossil fuel industries who currently sits on the board of the libertarian Heartland Institute, filed a shareholder proposal with Alliant Energy pressing the company to justify its ""pure fantasy"" of ever achieving net-zero emissions. Milloy also filed a proposal at Chevron that would require the energy giant to rescind its 2021 emissions reduction pledge. The proposal appears to have been crafted in conjunction with Strive Asset Management, the company founded by anti-woke firebrand and 2024 Republican presidential contender Vivek Ramaswamy. Investment fund magnate David Bahnsen filed a proposal with Chevron demanding that the company establish a committee to analyze the risks associated with decarbonization goals, and NCPPR filed a similar proposal with Duke Energy. Victims of ""Diversity"" Six of NCPPR's shareholder proposals raise concerns about racial justice initiatives undertaken by companies, a leitmotif in the Right's attacks on ""stakeholder capitalism"" and ESG investing, along with alleged reverse racism against white conservatives. Last year, the director's letter in NCPPR's Investor Value Voter Guide 2022 promised that the guide would help proxies vote ""against the new racism and sexism of 'equity'"" and ""other hard-left goals of so-called stakeholder capitalism and ESG."" (The organization's 2023 guide has not yet been released.) Other proposals focus on anti-discrimination and ""viewpoint diversity."" For instance, NCPPR's proposal for the grocery chain Kroger calls for a report detailing ""the potential risks associated with omitting 'viewpoint' and 'ideology' from its written equal employment opportunity (EEO) policy."" The SEC ruled that Kroger could omit the proposal. NCPPR warns against ""committing illegal or unconscionable discrimination against employees deemed 'non-diverse'"" in the name of ""so-called 'equity.'"" At Home Depot, NCPPR hopes to rescind the racial equity audit that shareholders agreed to at the company's 2022 annual meeting. In a proposal with McDonald's, NCPPR warns against ""committing illegal or unconscionable discrimination against employees deemed 'non-diverse'"" in the name of ""so-called 'equity.'"" NCPPR also takes up claims of liberal media bias and ""viewpoint discrimination"" in its proposal filed with AT&T, which criticizes the company for not renewing DirecTV's contract with the right-wing One America News (OAN) in the wake of its incendiary coverage of the 2020 presidential election and the subsequent insurrection. For reasons not disclosed, Inspire Investing, a ""biblically responsible"" investing firm that champions anti-abortion and anti-LGBTQ views, ended up withdrawing its proposal on the ""risks"" associated with anti-discrimination policies, which it had filed with M&T Bank. Abortion NCPPR filed an anti-abortion proposal with Eli Lilly, the Indianapolis-based pharmaceutical company, in which it calls for a report on the ""risks of supporting abortion."" NCPPR takes issue with the company's position that its ability to attract ""diverse employees"" has been hindered since Indiana passed an abortion ban in 2022, and therefore, that it needs to focus its expansion efforts outside the state. NCPPR argues that Eli Lilly's embrace of diversity ""ends at diversity of thought, opinion, and religious convictions."" The board has recommended voting against the proposal. Anti-abortion activist and semi-professional shareholder activist Thomas Strobhar also proposed a vote at Disney regarding transparency in charitable contributions. His organization, Life Decisions International, pressures companies to halt donations to Planned Parenthood. Guns NCPPR submitted a shareholder proposal to American Express that would have required the company to report on how it would ""reduce the risk associated with tracking, collecting, or sharing information"" regarding payment processing for the ""sale or purchase of firearms."" In March, the SEC ruled that American Express could omit the proposal from its proxy materials since it appeared to micromanage the company. Gun control advocates have long urged credit card companies to track gun and ammunition purchases as a way of curtailing rampant gun violence and mass shootings. Lawmakers in states such as New York have pressured Mastercard and American Express—both based in New York—to flag suspicious gun purchases. By contrast, Florida's Senate Bill 214—which penalizes financial companies for using a separate ""merchant category code"" for firearms—sailed through the Republican-controlled state senate in March and has crossed over into the house. The bill's lobbyists include Gun Owners of America, the political action arm of the Gun Owners Foundation, which has received funding from the right-wing Ed Uihlein Family Foundation and Shell Oil, according to tax filings. Bahnsen filed a shareholder proposal with MetLife taking issue with the company's decision ""not to offer a bulk discount to NRA members"" and to exclude ""firearms makers from investment portfolios."" Based on the gun industry's fear that President Biden will reinstate Operation Choke Point—an Obama-era program created to curtail bank fraud and discourage financial institutions from doing business with ""high-risk merchants""—NLPC filed three identical proposals with JPMorgan Chase, Mastercard, and Wells Fargo to require the companies to report on any government requests to close accounts, along with their own policies for dealing with those requests. The SEC denied the proposals made to JPMorgan and Wells Fargo, and, in early March, NLPC withdrew a comparable proposal with Mastercard. In a similar move, Bahnsen filed a shareholder proposal with MetLife taking issue with the company's decision ""not to offer a bulk discount to NRA members"" and to exclude ""firearms makers from investment portfolios"" (along with ""coal companies and oil sands extractors""), according to Proxy Preview. Bahnsen sits on the advisory board of the Viewpoint Diversity Score, a right-wing effort to negatively rate companies that take into account social justice concerns such as racial equity. The index, which is a project of the LGBTQ hate-group the Alliance Defending Freedom, received an Innovation Prize from the right-wing Heritage Foundation last year. ESG as Good Business Overall, the shareholder activism the Right has undertaken to counter corporate pressure from the Left has met with limited success. Anti-ESG proposals are typically unpopular with shareholders and on average garner 4% support or less. In addition, the volume of right-wing filings still pales in comparison with the number coming from progressive organizations. For example, As You Sow has filed at least 89 proposals this year, mostly related to advancing climate goals, diversity initiatives, and pro-union policies. Other anti-ESG shareholder strategies—such as the new proxy advisory services launched by Ramaswamy's company Strive—appear to be gaining traction. Indiana's Public Retirement System recently rewarded Strive a $150,000 no-bid contract. Social and climate risks have real impacts on the bottom line, and investors and customers increasingly expect businesses to take them into consideration. Yet the overwhelming response from corporate boardrooms has been: ESG policies make financial sense. As Andrew Winston argued in the Harvard Business Review, ""The banks pushing back on anti-ESG laws are not seeking medals for philanthropy; they're doing it because it's good business."" Social and climate risks have real impacts on the bottom line, and investors and customers increasingly expect businesses to take them into consideration. An entire generation of talent ""won't stay with us if we don't care about ESG or purpose or whatever we call it,"" Mars CEO Poul Weihrauch told Financial Times last month. ""So from my chair, I think it's a nonsense conversation. We don't believe that purpose and profit are enemies.""",Common Dreams,Top,No,2.3761412133743463,45.448131257032216,99.522701153675,16.626891974157825,86.66723501745957,64.68827471029039,right shareholder,{'capitalism': 'called'},"{'progressives': 'criticizing', 'justice': 'social', 'concerns': 'environmental', 'wing': 'right', 'groups': 'wing', 'strategy': 'same', 'companies': 'financial', 'shareholder': 'esg', 'governance': 'environmental', 'year': 'last', 'attempts': 'corporate', 'inaction': 'redress', 'inequity': 'racial', 'proposals': 'esg', 'meetings': 'annual', 'players': 'key', 'capitalism': 'called', 'group': 'called', 'corporations': 'multinational', 'organization': 'conservative', 'values': 'american', 'perspectives': 'conservative', 'agenda': 'extreme', 'threat': 'biggest', 'government': 'big', 'business': 'good', 'mill': 'wing', 'bill': 'corporate', 'legislation': 'corporate', 'executive': 'chief', 'warrior': '-', 'culture': 'woke', 'member': 'former', 'coalition': 'wing', 'market': 'free', 'donors': 'major', 'resolution': 'different', 'policies': 'union', 'funding': 'major', 'actions': 'additional', 'institutions': 'financial', 'week': 'next', 'columnist': 'former', 'fantasy': 'pure', 'firebrand': 'woke', 'contender': 'presidential', 'proposal': 'comparable', 'initiatives': 'racial', 'racism': 'new', 'conservatives': 'white', 'goals': 'left', 'risks': 'social', 'opportunity': 'equal', 'discrimination': 'illegal', 'equity': 'racial', 'audit': 'racial', 'meeting': 'annual', 'bias': 'liberal', 'coverage': 'incendiary', 'election': 'presidential', 'insurrection': 'subsequent', 'firm': 'responsible', 'views': 'lgbtq', 'company': 'based', 'employees': 'diverse', 'convictions': 'religious', 'activist': 'professional', 'contributions': 'charitable', 'violence': 'rampant', 'purchases': 'suspicious', 'code': 'separate', 'arm': 'political', 'discount': 'bulk', 'makers': 'firearms', 'risk': 'high', 'move': 'similar', 'board': 'advisory', 'effort': 'wing', 'pressure': 'corporate', 'success': 'limited', 'garner': 'average', 'organizations': 'progressive', 'strategies': 'anti', 'services': 'proxy', 'impacts': 'real', 'line': 'bottom', 'response': 'overwhelming', 'boardrooms': 'corporate', 'sense': 'financial', 'laws': 'esg', 'generation': 'entire', 'month': 'last'}",1,0

Seemingly taking issue with the BLM protests following the police killing of George Floyd, Aldean sings about how those who “cuss out a cop” or “stomp on the flag and light it up” will face retaliation from the “good ol’ boys” who were “raised up right” in the South.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,No,5.576077101291503,91.44620961492784,91.0441347580899,50.255156396744646,81.2016440573808,50.08390276701652,wing media,{'wing': 'right'},"{'song': 'lynching', 'man': 'black', 'criticism': 'most', 'boys': 'ol’'}",0,0

396,Ramaswamy,2023-07-20,"""Sexually repressed right-wingers would rather you sing about shooting people than ‘WAP’""","Opinion Country singer Jason Aldean is facing criticism following the release of the music video for his controversial song “Try That In A Small Town,” which was accused of being racist and pro-lynching.   Conservatives jumped to his defense, and tried to blunt left-wing outrage, by comparing the song to one they believe represents real vulgarity and degeneracy: Cardi B’s hit “WAP.” Critics of Aldean’s song and accompanying music video say its lyrics and visual imagery evoke a racist and pro-gun message by vilifying racial justice protests and promoting vigilante violence, which Aldean has denied. The lyrics of “Try That In A Small Town” are straight to the point, with Aldean singing about the retaliation people will face in a small town “full of good ol' boys, raised up right” for behaving in a certain way. “Cuss out a cop, spit in his face / Stomp on the flag and light it up / Yeah, ya think you're tough” Aldean sings. “Well, try that in a small town / See how far ya make it down the road / Around here, we take care of our own.”  Aldean’s music video was also condemned for the location where it was filmed, which has been identified as the Maury County Courthouse in Columbia, Tennessee, the site of an infamous lynching.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1_RKu-ESCY&ab_channel=JasonAldean As a result of this controversy, CMT pulled the music video from the country music network, prompting a sea of outrage from conservatives, with presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy claiming Aldean’s song simply defends American values. Others noted the message was clear, with people online tweeting about Kyle RIttenhouse, who killed two men during the 2020 George Floyd protests as the ideal Aldean was singing about. https://twitter.com/dudethatgolfs/status/1681796930152833024 Many right-wingers also jumped to the country star’s defense by comparing the song to Cardi B’s “WAP,” which they claim is more “offensive” due to its sexually explicit lyrics, pointing out that it still aired on the radio and even debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 songs chart.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siTGRbeq5K8&ab_channel=EAS7 “Apparently you can sing about WAP but not the values of a small town,” conservative commentator Tomi Lahren tweeted Wednesday. “Give me a break.” Turning Point USA founder Charlie Kirk posted the lyrics of the two songs side by side, tweeting, “Which do you think the media is mad about? WARNING: One of these is GRAPHIC and should NOT be read by minors, and the other is lyrics from Jason Aldean's song.” In a tongue-in-check tweet, actor Kevin Sorbo wrote that Aldean’s “newest single ‘Try That In A Small Town’ is offensive so we won’t play that… up next, WAP by Cardi B.” The comparison is an odd one, given the context of the two songs. “WAP” is a song about sex and female sexuality that contains explicit language and “Try That In A Small Town” is not.  “WAP,” by Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion, faced much consternation and hand-wringing over its NSFW lyrics and music video after its release in 2020. While fans view the song as empowering, others feel that it is inappropriate, with conservatives overwhelmingly criticizing the song for its brazen promotion of female sexual pleasure.  “This is what the feminist movement is all about. It’s not really about women being treated as independent, full-rounded human beings,” Daily Wire co-founder Ben Shapiro said at the time. “It’s about wet a– p-word.” Despite its graphic lyrics, however, “WAP” is not a song about threatening to shoot people for exercising their First Amendment rights, unlike “Try This In A Small Town.” And yet, many Twitter users echoed these same sentiments about the two wildly different songs. Some parroted them word for word, while others hurled insults at Aldean’s critics and broadly cast aspersions on modern society.  “If you're triggered by 'Try that in a small town' by @Jason_Aldean, but you have ‘WAP’ by Cardi B on your Playlist. Please seek help,” a self-proclaimed MAGA supporter wrote. “You have a mental disorder.”  In addition, a field representative for Rep. Barry Moore (R-Ala.) bemoaned CMT’s decision to pull Aldean’s music video and offered up his support for the country singer, tweeting, “How do we pull his song from the radio but keep @iamcardib ‘WAP.’ We have lost our way.” A few Twitter users have pushed back against this false equivalence, with one saying, “It’s the implied violence in the Jason Aldean song” that makes it controversial and ultimately not comparable to “WAP.” Although some conservatives argued there are many rap songs that promote violence and still get played on the air, a topic that deserves a more thoughtful and nuanced discussion, the more pervasive argument being circulated on social media was about “WAP.”  Still, it is telling that a song from a Black female rap artist was the first song to come to mind for these conservatives when countering allegations of violent and racist messaging in Aldean’s country song and music video. The Daily Wire’s Matt Walsh made a similarly bleak comparison, criticizing another Black woman’s rap song for being both popular and sexual in nature. Wednesday evening, Walsh tweeted a video from his podcast “The Matt Walsh Show,” in which he references Sexxy Redd’s song “Pound Town and disapprovingly reads the lyrics, captioning it, “Why is @Jason_Aldean being held to a standard that is never applied to the most popular rap artists in the world?” The answer? He’s not being held to the same standard as Cardi B or Sexxy Red. It's just that a number of sexually repressed conservatives think openly talking about sex is a much worse crime than taking the law into your own hands.

Ron DeSantis (Fla.), betting site PredictIt indicates. Over the weekend, DeSantis dropped below Ramaswamy on the online gambling service for the first time since the two entered the crowded race, which includes former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence.  DeSantis has been in the public eye for years since he took over Florida in 2019 and developed a firebrand personality. Meanwhile, Ramaswamy was relatively unknown when he entered the race and is running an underdog campaign. PredictIt works by having users buy shares in a given candidate’s likelihood of reaching a certain outcome while running for office, somewhat similar to the stock market. For the 2024 presidential nomination, people can invest in any candidate they think will win or lose, even ones who haven’t declared, like Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) Users of PredictIt make bets on candidates by buying shares, the price of which is between one dollar and 99 cents per share. On Friday, Ramaswamy reached 19 cents in favor of a win, which was two cents above where DeSantis stood. Ramaswamy then dropped to 17 cents, just barely above DeSantis’ 16 cents, before returning to the current neck-and-neck price with DeSantis at 15 cents. In the past 90 days, bets on DeSantis have hovered in the high 20s and low 30s. Ramaswamy started at just three cents at the end of last month, but quickly ascended to 14 cents in mid-July, as DeSantis has faltered.  Bets have wanted on DeSantis as he continues to lag behind Trump in a new national poll and is stumping on economic policy in New Hampshire. DeSantis’ campaign has been plagued by controversy lately, and he recently shed a third of his staff. He also recently let go an aide who shared a video that included Nazi symbolism. New Zealand political tech company Aristotle launched Predictit in 2014, and it caught the internet’s attention during the 2016 election, providing insight that some say is better than what’s gleaned from polls, which are more a reflection of where voters stand on a candidate at that point in time, not guessing who might win. PredictIt calls on participants to put their money on how people will vote in the future, while also allowing Americans to participate in legal gambling on elections. But it hasn’t always been on the mark. Jeb Bush was pinned as a favorite by betters on the site months before he eventually dropped out after a poor showing in South Carolina. Shortly before the 2020 presidential race was called, PredictIt showed Biden’s chances of winning at 84 percent.  Meanwhile, Ramaswamy is on a victory lap, celebrating his emergence as a leading candidate. He recently reached the unique donor threshold required to appear at the first GOP debate in August and received a standing ovation when he stopped at the Lincoln Day Dinner in Iowa.

The founders of the country created the judiciary as the third branch of the federal government to keep executive power in check and prevent corruption. So it was a cause for deep concern last week when Donald Trump unleashed a verbal tantrum on his Truth Social platform, accusing special counsel Jack Smith of “prosecutorial misconduct” even before he filed four federal criminal counts against the former president over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in a bid to remain in office.An identical barrage came last April when a Manhattan grand jury indicted Trump on 34 felony charges for falsifying business records. That time, he also called for defunding the justice department and the FBI, even though the charges did not come from either federal agency. Both reactions were part of a long-running campaign by Trump to undermine the rule of law in the US and dismiss the multiple charges he faces, and has denied, as politically motivated. Even lawyers who once supported Trump have told me that delegitimising the law and the judiciary could destroy the country’s system of government. Yet, even if he is convicted, Trump’s supporters will probably remain loyal to him, convinced that the entire legal system is “rigged” – a favourite Trumpism.

Referring to DeSantis as “GRD,” it said: “1. Attack Joe Biden and the media 3-5 times. 2. State GRD’s positive vision 2-3 times. 3. Hammer Vivek Ramaswamy in a response. 4. Defend Donald Trump in absentia in response to a Chris Christie attack.”Citing “Roger Ailes’ Orchestra Pit Theory,” the document recommended DeSantis go especially hard on Ramaswamy, who is rising in the polls, with the rather lame, Trump-style insult of “Fake Vivek” or “Vivek the Fake.” Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,No,7.351138077939336,69.3511399104193,99.86480110639836,68.90934884926354,77.2627161455614,88.30517400741165,desantis camp,{},"{'strategist': 'chief', 'look': 'extensive', 'advice': 'cringeworthy', 'debate': 'presidential', 'week': 'next', 'vision': 'positive', 'insult': 'lame'}",1,1

The documents, first reported by the New York Times, urged DeSantis ""to take a sledgehammer” to Vivek Ramaswamy, the Republican entrepreneur who has slowly been gaining in the polls. Dub the primary opponent ""Fake Vivek"" or ""Vivek the Fake,"" the memo advised. Ramaswamy responded to the report Thursday afternoon, who called it ""another boring, establishment attack from Super PAC-creation 'Robot Ron' who is literally taking lame, pre-programmed attack lines against me for next week’s debate."" https://twitter.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1692202661410750526 The strategy documents indicate that DeSantis' campaign may view Ramaswamy as his biggest threat at the Aug. 23 debate, given that former President Donald Trump is not expected to participate. Ramaswamy, a political newcomer, has recently been closing the gap between him and DeSantis. A RealClearPolitics polling average between July 23-Aug. 15 shows Ramaswamy in third place with 6.7%, about eight points behind DeSantis. That's a 4.3-point increase for Ramaswamy in the last two months, compared to a 5.4-point decrease for DeSantis. And Ramaswamy is polling ahead of former Vice President Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Chris Christie—all of whom had bigger name recognition coming into the race than Ramaswamy. While the debate memo also encouraged DeSantis to defend Trump in absentia from attacks wielded by Christie, Trump has celebrated DeSantis' drop in polls, referencing a recent survey by RMG Research. The polling firm holds a B- rating from FiveThirtyEight. ""It’s over for Ron DeSanctimonious, now in 3rd place. Ramaswamy now in 2nd,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday. ""RMG Research.

Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), who continues plummeting in 2024 presidential primary polls. Some people on Twitter are noticing that he might not be handling the pressure so well. In a video posted by Fox News' Paul Steinhauser, DeSantis seems to barely be able to contain the tension when he’s asked about a recently leaked memo posted online by a company with close links to Never Back Down, a super PAC close to the DeSantis’ campaign.  According to the New York Times, which first reported the memo, Never Back Down “has effectively taken over … [DeSantis’] presidential campaign.” The memo, posted on the website of a close advisor to the super PAC, lays out a strategy for the governor to follow to stand out on the stage, including attacking the surging Vivek Ramaswamy as a “fake” and defending former president Donald Trump, who won’t be on the stage, from an attack by Chris Christie. https://twitter.com/steinhauserNH1/status/1692973204510306561 Steinhauser asked DeSantis first about the idea that the “knives will be out” for him at the Republican primary debate on Wednesday.  DeSantis gave the reporter a pained smile in response. Then, when Steinhauser asked a question about the memo, DeSantis can clearly be seen grinding his teeth as the question is asked. “Hes got Homelander tics now,” commented Twitter user @lib_crusher in a retweet. https://twitter.com/lib_crusher/status/1693347306735632733 Homelander, played by Antony Starr in the Amazon Prime series The Boys, often responds to tension and anxiety by subtly grinding his teeth and blowing air out of his mouth while hearing a ringing sound. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh-F6QzJdrE “Starr clenches his teeth and or blows air into his lower lip and cheek area when homelander is trying to suppress anger or remain calm,” explained u/TlN4C in an r/TheBoys thread discussing the show. “I cannot unsee him as homelander now, thanks,” wrote @Twitter user Joexor. “I will never unsee it now” wrote Twitter user @D_Bowey. “This is creepy how accurate it is” Twitter user @Spoopy0_0 wrote. Twitter user @EliotETC jumped on the comparison by editing in the audio track from the show and zooming in on DeSantis, showing just how agitated and anxious he seems to appear. https://twitter.com/EliotETC/status/1693369246422798532 “I bet that guy's long dark nights of the soul are something else altogether,” commented Twitter user @DismalChips. “Those are the eyes of a man who stares daily into the abyss.” DeSantis’ campaign didn’t respond to a question about whether DeSantis sees a resemblance to the character.

870,Ramaswamy,2023-08-22,"""Vivek Ramaswamy dubbed ‘VivekGPT’ as critics highlight tech entrepreneur’s ever-shifting answers""","Gov. Ron DeSantis’ (R-Fla.) Super PAC told him to call biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy “Vivek the Fake” or “Fake Vivek” in the upcoming Republican presidential primary debate, but neither of those ones really seemed to fit. Now, Twitter users have landed on VivekGPT, a nod to how the popular AI ChatGPT tool performs, giving you any answer you want as long as you ask him the question the right way. ChatGPT is a large language model that users can “chat” with and receive what seems like natural answers. But ChatGPT has also been criticized for not returning consistent responses and tailoring its output to the way a question is asked. Now, it's being used on the breakout Republican candidate. “‘VivekGPT’ is as close to perfection as nicknames get. Kudos to whomever came up with it,” wrote Twitter user @PowerOwn45. “VivekGPT doesn’t care about beliefs or if the claim makes sense,” wrote @AGHamilton29. “He just automatically calculates how he can frame the convo to appeal to a specific subgroup of voters,” calling him a “ChatGPT"" candidate. His position on COVID-19, in particular, has been called out as GPT-esque. Ramaswamy has been critical of the U.S. government’s COVID pandemic response during his campaign and he criticized the idea that the disease has a natural origin. But the biotech entrepreneur’s company Datavant also pitched a data repository for COVID patients, which some conservatives have dubbed a “COVID passport.” “LMAO VivekGPT tried to sell a Covid passport system to the government,” pointed out @redneckskeptic. “He’s hardly pro-medical choice. Unless you believe his words vs his actions.” Ramaswamy has also been criticized for blatantly inconsistent positions, like when he denied suggesting pardoning members of Biden’s family, which he did suggest doing, or his recent hullabaloo over 9/11, where he claimed then denied he claimed the attack was an inside job. Today, Twitter users also highlighted how that same sort of flip-flopping inconsistency reared its head when it came to whether Trump should appear at the Republican presidential debate tomorrow. “It would be fundamentally uncourageous for Donald Trump to choose not to debate,” Ramaswamy is shown saying in a video posted by Twitter user @AGHamilton29. The video then cuts to Ramaswamy being asked if he thinks Trump should attend the first Republican debate. “I don’t have a strong opinion on it,” he answers, before a hard cut to Ramaswamy standing in front of his campaign bus. “Trump will be there because as I’ve known him, he’s not a man to be afraid,” Ramaswamy says. https://twitter.com/AGHamilton29/status/1694075008308351461 “This is bizarre to watch,” commented a Republican communications strategist, Matt Whitlock. “[H]ow does he take fifteen different positions on whether or not Trump should debate in just like 2 months? VivekGPT is spot on.” https://twitter.com/mattdizwhitlock/status/1694077213660811619 The name was almost perfect for Twitter user @DastDn, who had only one problem with it. “Super torn. On the one hand, the temptation to refer to Ramaswamy as VivekGPT from now own is nigh unbearable. On the other - that a whole 3 extra letters.” Twitter user @FilmLadd summed it up succintly: “VivekGPT and ChatGPT both suffer from the problems of making s--t up and not knowing what's real and what isn't.” Sign up to receive the Daily Dot’s Internet Insider newsletter for urgent news from the frontline of online.

1170,Ramaswamy,2023-08-25,"""After Almost a Decade of Missed Deadlines, EPA Ordered to Finalize Ethylene Oxide Regulations""","Yesterday, the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia signed a consent decree mandating the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to finalize much-needed updates to ethylene oxide regulations by March 1, 2024. This court-enforced deadline comes as a result of years of tireless advocacy from communities across the country and a corresponding lawsuit filed by Earthjustice on behalf of California Communities Against Toxics, Clean Power Lake County, Rio Grande International Study Center, Sierra Club, and Union of Concerned Scientists. Initially filed in December 2022, the lawsuit challenged EPA’s failure to take legally required action to protect the public from harmful carcinogenic air emissions from ethylene oxide sterilization facilities. “Today’s consent decree signing is a critical step to ensuring that communities across the U.S. get needed protections from ethylene oxide emissions from commercial sterilizers. For years, EPA has promised new regulations to rein in commercial sterilizers’ toxic ethylene oxide emissions,” said Earthjustice Senior Attorney Marvin Brown. “And after years of missing their own deadlines, we sued and secured a judicially enforceable deadline. Now EPA must do its part and ensure that its sterilizer rule protects communities from this cancer-causing pollution.” Ethylene oxide is a colorless, typically odorless, flammable gas used to sterilize medical equipment and in the production of chemicals needed for antifreeze, plastics, detergents, and adhesives. It is one of the most toxic air pollutants EPA regulates. This toxic chemical is a known carcinogen to humans, especially when inhaled. EPA updated ethylene oxide’s toxicity value in 2016 and admits that the chemical is 60 times more toxic than previously estimated. Despite this new assessment, it has taken EPA seven years to propose new standards while countless people and their families were left vulnerable to chronic — sometimes fatal — health impacts of ethylene oxide exposure. Now, the agency must use the best-available science to enact the strongest possible protections to ensure that impacted communities will not continue to be subjected to exposure to this aggressive carcinogen. Quotes from our Clients: “As a result of the collaboration of environmental justice communities and national environmental organizations, today marks a monumental step towards cleaner air,” said Celeste Flores, Clean Power Lake County (IL) steering committee member. “We are one step closer to ensuring that the EPA finalizes the crucial commercial sterilizer rules for EtO. We urge the EPA to act swiftly and pass the strongest regulations for healthy communities.” “EPA must adopt strong, health-protective enforceable limits on ethylene oxide for our nation’s 78 sterilizers and their warehouses that include fenceline monitoring to verify those limits are being met,” stated Jane Williams of California Communities Against Toxics. “Thank goodness that we have groups like Earthjustice to fight for us so that agencies like the EPA do much more to protect communities like ours that face extremely high cancer level risks due to dangerous ethylene oxide emissions from commercial sterilizer companies like Midwest Sterilization,” said Tricia Cortez of Rio Grande International Study Center in Laredo, TX. “We need the EPA to pass the strongest rule possible, as quickly as possible.” “Families across Texas have been forced to grapple with the pervasive health and environmental impacts of ethylene oxide emissions. EPA’s harmful inaction on regulating ethylene oxide has benefitted the profits of the sterilizer industry at the expense of the health and well-being of countless families,” said Neil Carman, Sierra Club’s Lone Star Chapter’s Clean Air Program Director. “Now the clock is ticking for the agency needs to act as swiftly as possible to finalize the strongest possible protections for the environment and public health.”",Common Dreams,Top,No,9.949893167828348,99.69409664828191,93.04671470027972,96.2197783057782,73.33225015301201,83.12829239692941,decade missed,{},"{'updates': 'needed', 'deadline': 'enforceable', 'advocacy': 'tireless', 'lawsuit': 'corresponding', 'action': 'required', 'emissions': 'dangerous', 'step': 'monumental', 'protections': 'possible', 'sterilizers': 'commercial', 'regulations': 'strongest', 'deadlines': 'own', 'pollution': 'causing', 'gas': 'flammable', 'equipment': 'medical', 'pollutants': 'toxic', 'chemical': 'toxic', 'carcinogen': 'aggressive', 'oxide': 'updated', 'assessment': 'new', 'standards': 'new', 'people': 'countless', 'impacts': 'pervasive', 'science': 'available', 'communities': 'healthy', 'justice': 'environmental', 'organizations': 'environmental', 'air': 'cleaner', 'member': 'steering', 'rules': 'commercial', 'limits': 'enforceable', 'level': 'high', 'companies': 'commercial', 'rule': 'possible', 'inaction': 'harmful', 'families': 'countless', 'health': 'public'}",0,0

We are prepared to raise rates further if appropriate.” Powell’s hawkish tone on higher interest rates comes on the heels of a new survey finding U.S. consumer demand is contracting for both manufactured goods and services, which in turns threatens layoffs. Powell made no acknowledgement of the warnings voiced by a chorus of experts that continuing to raise rates would needlessly cause a recession and cost millions of Americans their jobs. “The Fed’s interest rate hike strategy has done little to contain the corporate greed epidemic fueling high costs, while it has been very effective at extinguishing consumer demand,” said Liz Zelnick, Director of government watchdog Accountable.US’ Economic Security & Corporate Power program. “If the Fed moves forward with another interest rate hike that puts new cars and houses out of reach for many Americans, it could drive demand down to dangerous territory, tarring the economic gains led by the Biden Administration.

1182,Ramaswamy,2023-08-25,"""Lawsuit Challenges Massive Offshore Lease Sale for Failing to Consider Gulf Communities, Climate""","Gulf community and environmental groups sued the Interior Department today to challenge an offshore oil and gas lease sale that would offer up more than 67 million acres in the Gulf of Mexico. The department plans to hold the sale Sept. 27. Lease Sale 261, which the Biden administration canceled in 2021, is the last of three offshore oil and gas lease sales mandated under the Inflation Reduction Act. Lease Sales 258 and 259, held in December 2022 and March 2023, were also revived by the IRA. Those lease sales were challenged in federal court for failing to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act.Today’s lawsuit challenges the upcoming lease sale for violating NEPA because Interior did not consider the health threats to Gulf Coast communities living near oil refineries and other polluting drilling infrastructure. The department also failed to adequately consider the climate harm from this massive new source of fossil fuel production. The lease sale could result in the production of more than 1 billion barrels of oil and 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over the next 50 years, resulting in more than 370 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions.The department agreed to limit the leasing area to reduce the risk of driving the endangered Rice’s whale to extinction. Scientists estimate there may be only 51 Rice’s whales left on Earth.The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the District of Columbia on behalf of Healthy Gulf, Bayou City Waterkeeper, Friends of the Earth, Center for Biological Diversity, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Sierra Club.In September, Interior is expected to release its final proposed five-year program for offshore oil and gas leasing. The plan, which lasts through 2028, could include as many as 11 new offshore lease sales. Holding 11 new fossil fuel auctions would sanction up to 70 years of additional fossil-fuel extraction with the potential to emit up to 3.5 billion tons of carbon pollution.Statements from Earthjustice, its clients and partners:“Once again, the Biden administration has fallen short of the federal law by neglecting to consider the impact of this massive oil sale on Gulf communities and the climate,” said Earthjustice attorney George Torgun. “We’re pleased that Interior excluded habitat for the nearly extinct Gulf of Mexico whale from this lease sale, but it’s equally critical that Interior builds on this step and protects climate and Gulf communities from the harms of leasing.”“Unfortunately, given BOEM’s history of sacrificing the Gulf of Mexico to Big Oil, this lease sale decision comes as no surprise,” said Hallie Templeton, legal director of Friends of the Earth. “Our lawsuit should also come as no surprise, since BOEM continues to rely on the same outdated, broken environmental analysis. If we are going to make a dent in the climate crisis, business as usual must stop. We are going to keep fighting until the Gulf of Mexico is off the table for good.”“As steward of the country’s public lands and waters, Interior has a duty to fully consider the harms offshore leasing can cause, from air pollution to oil spills, and beyond,” said Julia Forgie, attorney for NRDC (the Natural Resources Defense Council). “This vast lease sale — for millions of acres — poses threats to Gulf communities and endangered species while contributing to the climate crisis this region knows far too well. We are holding the agency to its obligation to carefully assess these risks and the climate fallout of this giveaway to Big Oil.”“It’s mind-boggling that in this summer of deadly fossil fuel-driven record heat, fires and flooding the Biden administration couldn’t be bothered to look carefully at the damage this lease sale will cause to people, endangered wildlife and the climate,” said Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Across the country we’re seeing lethal wildfires, boiling ocean temperatures and mass coral die-offs, all caused or exacerbated by a climate unnaturally warmed by fossil fuel emissions. We’ve got to stop letting oil and gas companies make it worse by drilling in our oceans.”“It is time to transition away from fossil fuels,” said Kristen Schlemmer, legal director and waterkeeper for Bayou City Waterkeeper. “Continued development in the Gulf of Mexico creates unfair burdens on communities in Houston and across the Gulf South. Moving forward with Lease Sale 261 means more drilling in the years to come. It means more facilities in our backyards. It means higher rates of cancer and heart and lung diseases, and it means more risks during major storms.”“Selling public lands and waters to Big Polluters is incompatible with achieving the ambitious climate goals the Biden Administration itself has set,” said Devorah Ancel, Sierra Club Environmental Law Program senior attorney. “Fossil fuel extraction is destructive to communities, ecosystems, wildlife, and our climate. The devastating effects of climate change, from heat waves to storms, are particularly harmful to frontline communities, as this summer has shown. Moving forward with this lease sale locks us into extraction for decades to come, right as we should be transitioning to clean energy.”",Common Dreams,Top,No,9.949893167828348,95.67659315166097,99.68949336671486,96.2197783057782,73.33225015301201,83.12829239692941,lawsuit massive,{},"{'groups': 'environmental', 'sale': 'vast', 'sales': 'new', 'court': 'federal', 'infrastructure': 'polluting', 'source': 'new', 'feet': 'cubic', 'gas': 'natural', 'years': 'next', 'program': 'proposed', 'leasing': 'offshore', 'lease': 'offshore', 'auctions': 'new', 'extraction': 'additional', 'fuel': 'fossil', 'law': 'federal', 'director': 'legal', 'analysis': 'environmental', 'lands': 'public', 'species': 'endangered', 'heat': 'driven', 'wildlife': 'endangered', 'wildfires': 'lethal', 'fuels': 'fossil', 'development': 'continued', 'burdens': 'unfair', 'drilling': 'more', 'facilities': 'more', 'rates': 'higher', 'risks': 'more', 'storms': 'major', 'goals': 'ambitious', 'attorney': 'senior', 'effects': 'devastating'}",0,0
1183,Ramaswamy,2023-08-25,"""In a Summer of Climate Chaos, Fed Summit Ignores Risk of Climate Crisis to Global Economy""","Today, over 70 international, national and state/local organizations released an open letter to the Federal Reserve and central bankers attending this year’s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. The letter calls on symposium participants to act quickly and vigorously to address recent escalations in climate-related financial risks. In remarks this morning, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell omitted any mention of climate-related financial risks in his Jackson Hole speech. The open letter notes that climate change impacts are outpacing authorities’ current efforts to address climate change financial risks. This is evidenced by escalating costs of physical risks and growing gaps in insurance coverage, among other things. Policy makers, especially in the banking and insurance sectors, must: Adopt a precautionary approach to risk mitigation, given climate change’s tipping points and unpredictable tail risks. This could include capital adjustments and other mechanisms to properly reflect the risk of fossil fuel production and thus facilitate a transition;Design capital buffers that specifically take into account the systemic risks of climate change;Require the use of forward-looking tools, such as transition plans, which can help both authorities and market participants better understand and mitigate their own climate-related transition risks, as well as improve understanding of aggregated, systemic risks and promote accountability. Elizabeth Jacobs, a Sustainable Finance Specialist at E3G said: “Jackson Hole is a unique setting, and not only for its natural beauty. At the 2005 Jackson Hole Symposium, warnings about risks building up in the financial system were minimized. Within the next 5 years, the Global Financial Crisis ensued, and policy makers were promptly consumed with giving themselves new authorities designed to avert future crises. Using precautionary approaches and transition plans can help avoid a ruinous rinse, wash, repeat cycle.”Alex Martin, Climate Finance Policy Director at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund said: “Financial regulators have put in increasing effort in recent years to try to understand and better manage climate risk, but unfortunately, climate change is vastly outpacing their progress. Precious little time remains to get ahead of the risk as insurers flee vulnerable areas and banks respond in kind. Resigning ourselves to merely picking up the pieces after climate-driven financial disruptions and crises unfold—which is where we are headed—is utterly unacceptable. Regulators must double down now.""David Arkush, director of Public Citizen’s Climate Program, said: “It is shocking that this symposium, which purports to address structural shifts in the global economy, does not include a single agenda item on the climate crisis or climate solutions — some of the most important drivers of change in the global economy and most significant sources of risk to global financial stability. Rather than stand by as the next global financial crisis develops, the top officials and economists at this conference should be actively considering responses and solutions. And the officials should adopt assertive policies that shepherd the economy and financial system swiftly and safely through the tumultuous climate-related transitions that are already underway.”Jackie Fielder, co-director of Stop the Money Pipeline coalition said: “Any symposium entitled ‘Structural Shifts in the Global Economy’ without a single mention of climate disasters and the billions they have cost everyday people and local economies, should concern every American with a pension who agrees that climate change is here.”Akiksha Chatterji, lead campaigner at Positive Money US said: ""Regulators are failing to act at the scale or pace necessary to curb the significant financial stability threats arising from climate change and fossil fuel financing. Rest assured, climate risks will materialise and we simply cannot quantify the precise nature and timing of these impacts as they are complex and ever changing. Emergency measures taken after a climate-driven financial crash may not suffice to contain such a meltdown. It’s time for the regulators and officials at this symposium to adopt a precautionary approach to climate and do their jobs before another financial crisis ensues.""",Common Dreams,Top,No,9.949893167828348,50.57995926406624,90.9630225778336,96.2197783057782,73.33225015301201,83.12829239692941,climate summer,{},"{'organizations': 'international', 'letter': 'open', 'bankers': 'central', 'escalations': 'recent', 'risks': 'systemic', 'efforts': 'current', 'gaps': 'growing', 'things': 'other', 'approach': 'precautionary', 'mechanisms': 'other', 'buffers': 'transition;design', 'tools': 'looking', 'setting': 'unique', 'beauty': 'natural', 'system': 'financial', 'years': 'recent', 'authorities': 'new', 'crises': 'future', 'approaches': 'precautionary', 'rinse': 'ruinous', 'regulators': 'financial', 'effort': 'increasing', 'time': 'little', 'areas': 'vulnerable', 'disruptions': 'financial', 'shifts': 'structural', 'economy': 'global', 'item': 'single', 'drivers': 'important', 'sources': 'significant', 'stability': 'financial', 'crisis': 'financial', 'officials': 'top', 'policies': 'assertive', 'transitions': 'related', 'mention': 'single', 'people': 'everyday', 'economies': 'local', 'pace': 'necessary', 'threats': 'significant', 'nature': 'precise', 'crash': 'financial'}",0,0

He played Trump 2.0 on the scene by fiercely interrupting other candidates and constantly referring to himself as the “not bought by corporate money politician.” Ramaswamy’s strategy was clearly a nod to the front-runner of the Republican primary, Donald Trump, who also started his 2016 campaign by saying, “I’m so rich I can’t be bought.” Ramaswamy might be the first candidate I’ve ever seen to imitate the ignorant arrogance of Trump and then quickly switch lanes and say, “I’m a skinny kid with a funny name,” clearly a nod to former president Barack Obama’s 2004 DNC speech where he introduced himself to the nation. But Ramaswamy’s policy plans, like Trump’s, are insidious; Ramaswamy wants to completely dismantle the foundations our country was built on.Two of the most significant policy ideas Ramaswamy’s constantly been pushing—rescinding birthright citizenship and elevating the voting age from 18 to 25—reveal a profound commitment to overhauling fundamental aspects of our Constitution. It’s not just about trimming budgets and reducing staff; it’s about reshaping the very core of our founding document.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,Yes,9.998189563416284,97.5187905889917,99.29435623334165,96.72732721249898,63.78052368978054,76.40096793123759,vivek ramaswamy,{},"{'outlier': 'clear', 'candidates': 'other', 'politician': 'corporate', 'runner': 'front', 'primary': 'republican', 'candidate': 'first', 'arrogance': 'ignorant', 'kid': 'skinny', 'name': 'funny', 'president': 'former', 'ideas': 'significant', 'citizenship': 'birthright', 'commitment': 'profound', 'aspects': 'fundamental', 'core': 'very', 'document': 'founding'}",1,0

Trump prompted intense coverage and detailed discussions in the Kremlin-controlled state media. Russian propagandists and analysts speculate that the criminal prosecutions won’t hurt their favorite candidate, but only bolster his popularity. Encouraged by their belief that most of the GOP’s top contenders would limit or stop U.S. aid to Ukraine, Russian talking heads nonetheless prefer Trump himself.Referring to Trump’s booking record in Georgia, reporter Valentin Bogdanov, who is based in New York City, told the audience of 60 Minutes, “Our strawberry blonde! There is only one like him in the United States.” In his report for the evening edition of Vesti on channel Rossiya-1, Bogdanov showcased Trump’s mugshot along with that of Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, and Elvis Presley. He mused that in his legal struggle, Trump likely sees his rightful place alongside Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela, like someone “who suffered for the sake of truth.”During his Saturday show on channel Solovyov Live, Yevgeny Satanovsky continued the same train of thought, lionizing Trump alongside some of the most prominent historic figures: “He is like Nelson Mandela, like Martin Luther King Jr., he is being persecuted by an evil shadow government!” Satanovsky feverishly claimed that Trump might be assassinated, like Abraham Lincoln or John F.

1218,Ramaswamy,2023-08-27,"""The Hollow Men (and Woman)""","What to say on the surreal spectacle of the eight tawdry GOP cranks, morons, misanthropes and ""political pygmies,"" minus their dark overlord, who gathered this week to spew hate, lies and ugly talking points - migrants! teachers! Soros! Hunter! abortion up to birth! Trans Marxists in bathrooms! - as sorry also-rans in a bleakly unpresidential race to the bottom. For Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, today's GOP evokes T.S. Eliot’s The Hollow Men: “This is the way the world ends/Not with a bang but a whimper.” Trump, of course, skipped the Fox-aired ""debate"" between clowns and thugs to witlessly blather with Tucker Carlson, who a few months ago declared of the multi-indicted former etc, ""I hate him passionately""; still, they gamely rambled through the vital issues of the day: the possible murder of Jeffrey Epstein - ""I will say he was a fixture in Palm Beach"" - by Bill Barr; ""the Left"" as ""savage animals...really sick""; the deep state plot to limit water in washing machines; Jan. 6 rioters behaving ""peacefully and patriotically."" Many chose not to watch either Trump or his fellow-cretins; explained one patriot, ""I was too busy working on my 'Mugshots of Treason' collectible trading cards."" For those unfortunates who ventured forth to bear witness to two hours of fascist-flavored gas-lighting, fear-mongering, ""substanceless statements"" and ""gelatinous ideas"" cheered on by an audience of gullible, complicit yahoos, they beheld a toxic yet vacant party that ""has become meaner, dumber, and wholly divorced from the issues Americans actually care about."" It was, argued Peter Birkenhead, like ""watching cancer cells debate health.""The event seemed even more bizarre in light of the next day's arrest of the felon who leads them all by an incomprehensible mile. Reflecting the warped, alternate reality in which their party now resides, candidates gamely pretended there was some actual reason for them to be lumbering through a contest both ""chaotic and boring,"" devoid of ideas or principles but steeped in belligerent buzzwords and ""word-salad recitation of right-wing talking points""; even so, they largely rallied the domestic terrorist troops only at ominous nods to China, Mexico, Soros, teachers' unions and other fictional seeds of their discontent. Even there in placid, mid-Western Milwaukee, the thematic darkness was clear from an incendiary opening montage of protesters, immigrants, burning cities, rampaging crime, all the evils Trump raged about in his famously deranged inaugural vow, “This American carnage stops right here and right now” - which George Bush later dubbed ""some weird shit."" Yes, but still weirdly persisting. ""Republican debates once were celebrations of American greatness,"" notes Eugene Robinson. ""Now, they are wallows in American grievance.""Thus did all eight candidates, voicing the affronted victimhood of today's right wing, labor to portray ""the wealthiest, most powerful country on Earth as some kind of hellish dystopia."" They feverishly cited civic mayhem, urban rubble, the imaginary threats of immigrant hordes, Marxist mobs, CRT and swimming trans kids and abortion ""all the way up to the moment of birth"" (which doesn't exist) while - irony alert - universally rejecting climate change, the one real danger confronting us, as ""a hoax."" ""It is not morning in America - we live in a dark moment,” declaimed businessman, loudmouth and wannabe demagogue Vivek Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old, wildly uninformed political novice who insisted, ""We're in the middle of a national identity crisis,"" maybe thanks to a presidential contender in such moronic denial of climate change he shrilly promises to ""drill, frack, burn coal, embrace nuclear"" while claiming ""more people are dying of bad climate change policies than (of) actual climate change."" More of his red-meat nuggets of wisdom: The nuclear family is ""the greatest form of governance known to mankind,"" the ""only war I will declare as President will be the war on the federal administrative state!” and, straight-faced, ""Trump is the best president of the 21st century.""Along with brazenly, incongruously stealing Obama lines - ""Who the heck is this skinny guy with a funny last name?"" he suggested the audience was thinking - Ramaswamy proved the ""weirdest guy on stage,"" surpassing even weird DeSantis, in his garish performance as a ""Trumpier than Trump"" huckster who, like ""your annoying college roommate,"" eagerly jumps into every exchange despite having no idea what he's talking about. Hence, some barbed exchanges: To his claim we shouldn't support Ukraine, Nikki Haley snapped, “You are choosing a murderer over a pro-American country. You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows."" Bizarrely, it was Ramaswamy who led the cheer-leading charge for Trump - while ostensibly running against him - after co-moderator Bret Baier announced ""a brief moment (to) talk about the elephant not in the room."" When Baier asked the motley assemblage who'd still support for ""president"" the thug facing 91 felony charges if he's convicted, Ramaswamy's hand shot up, followed by Tim Scott, Doug Burgum and Haley; excruciatingly, they were slowly joined by a sheepish Pence though Trump tried to get him hung, and shamefaced profile in courage DeSantis after he looked to see what everyone else did. The crowd cheered.DeSantis was widely deemed the evening's biggest loser, alternately angry, evasive, rictus-grimacing, stiffly canned - ""Send Joe Biden back to his basement!"" - and wooden even when issuing murderous edicts on migrants: ""We're going (to) leave them stone-cold dead."" He often appeared notably clueless: Asked, ""How would you fix the American economy?"", he responded, ""You bring Anthony Fauci (now a retired doctor) into the Oval Office (and) you say, ‘ANTHONY YOU ARE FIRED!’” Umm. He also trashed Hunter Biden's ""lousy paintings,"" criticized ""lockdowns"" that don't exist, crudely bragged about the evils he's inflicted on Florida, dodged a question on a national abortion ban but said he loved his kids' sonograms and wants ""a culture of life,"" told a freakish, bogus story - ""I know a lady in Florida"" though it was Michigan - about a woman born alive in 1955 after a botched abortion, threw in a quick anti-Semitic jab at ""George-Soros backed"" prosecutors ""victimizing innocent people,"" and oddly declined to use his fave term ""woke"" (Nikki Halley did once with ""crazy, woke things"" in schools) though he's proudly, ceaselessly proclaimed ad nauseum, ""Florida is where woke goes to die."" Huh. Now it seems Milwaukee is where it, and he, will meet their welcome, unseemly end.Sadly but predictably, the other incoherent also-rans didn't fare any better. Asked about crime, Tim Scott said the first thing he'd do is fire Merrick Garland; he also often said ""single-parent household"" and ""God’s green Earth."" Asked about the economy, Mike Pence boasted he and Trump added three zealots to the Supreme Court; he also reminded an audience of mindless, bloodthirsty, GOP nihilists he ""upheld the Constitution"" but didn't admit, per Chris Hayes, it was 'cause he ""didn't want to be another guy with a mugshot."" Nikki Haley thought there might be climate change but still China, China, China, also India. Nobody mentioned gun violence that's now the leading killer of kids in America, though this weekend saw another shooting, in DeSantis' assault-rifle-filled Florida, with ""mass fatalities."" All told, the ""debate"" laid bare a party ""unmoored from reality,"" bereft of ideas, values or policies and filling the vacuum with culture wars, racist tropes, ugly scapegoating. It struck Roy Edroso, who ""watched as much as I could,"" as ""something out of a neurological experiment,"" clearly not benign. He saw a cheap ""trunk show...loud, fast, and out of control,"" with no winners: ""Nobody...not even the screamers, expects to see a president come out of this.""Many concurred on a malignant shipwreck of a party hollowed out and stripped down to its meanest, rankest parts by a two-bit grifter - now hawking ""Never Surrender"" mugs and t-shirts marking his 4th surrender - who's left behind the ragged survivors to sink or less-than-convincingly swim. For fans of Succession, the debate's shabby specimens evoked Logan Roy's searing, mournful appraisal of his dysfunctional offspring: ""You are not serious people."" Noticeably escaping unscathed from the GOP debacle was Joe Biden, who happily embraced his no-malarkey alter-ego Dark Brandon, complete with laser-shooting eyes, in some strong messaging on Fox and around Milwaukee. Billboards featuring Biden/Brandon brashly declared, ""Social Security Cuts? Try Me"" and ""Get Real Jack. I'm Bringing Roe Back."" Biden was also on X, the dumb new name for Twitter, snarking away. To the inane claim climate change is ""a hoax,"" he retorted, “Climate change is real, by the way”; to Haley's admission that Trump added $8 billion to the national debt, he wrote, ""What she said.""
