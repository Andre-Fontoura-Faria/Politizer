8,Biden,2023-05-02,"""My Advice to Biden on Debt Ceiling Faceoff With GOP: Play Hard Ball""","If House Republicans refuse to raise the limit on the amount of money America may repay on what it owes — the deceptively named “debt limit” — they might force the United States to default, pushing interest rates into the stratosphere and shaking the world economy. President Biden rightfully says that raising the so-called debt ceiling should not be negotiable. After all, Democrats joined Republicans during the Trump administration to raise it three times, even as Trump and the Republicans enacted a major tax cut for big corporations and the wealthy that caused the nation’s debt to soar.Yet now, Kevin McCarthy and his band of Republican radicals are demanding that in return for their agreement to raise the debt ceiling, Biden and Democrats make drastic cuts in programs Americans rely on — in everything from from public safety to health care to education.My advice to Joe Biden: Ignore McCarthy and the Republican radicals. Mr. President, your oath to uphold the Constitution takes precedence. As the supreme law of the land, the Constitution has greater weight than the debt ceiling.My advice to Joe Biden: Ignore McCarthy and the Republican radicals. Section 4 of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution states that “The validity of the public debt of the United States … shall not be questioned.”A debt ceiling that prevents the federal government from honoring its existing financial commitments violates the Constitution.So, if House Republicans refuse to raise the debt ceiling, you are obligated by the U.S. Constitution and your oath of office to ignore the debt ceiling and continue to pay the debts of the United States.Should they wish, let the radical Republicans take you to court. Even the Republican radicals on the Supreme Court will likely support you. No “originalist” interpretation of the Constitution could read that document differently. A debt ceiling that prevents the federal government from honoring its existing financial commitments violates the Constitution.The Constitution makes it clear that Congress’s power to borrow money does not include the power to default on such borrowing.The original intent of the drafters of the Constitution in 1787 was to give Congress the power to tax and borrow to pay debts and to provide for the common defense and public welfare. As Alexander Hamilton wrote in Federalist No. 30, the power to tax and borrow was established to ensure payment of debt or to prevent a default.The “Second Founders” who amended the Constitution after the Civil War explicitly forbade Congress, or anyone, from repudiating or defaulting on the debt.The Republicans want to lure you into a cynical game, Mr. President. The nation needs you to play hardball by ignoring them.",Common Dreams,Business,Yes,66.47906734084455,13.743544995185896,99.05585698569888,90.95043843770608,51.45771252739863,6.90730045730804,advice biden,{},"{'limit': 'named', 'ceiling': '”a', 'cut': 'major', 'corporations': 'big', 'radicals': 'republican', 'cuts': 'drastic', 'safety': 'public', 'weight': 'greater', 'debt': 'public', 'government': 'federal', 'commitments': 'financial', 'borrowing': 'such', 'intent': 'original', 'defense': 'common', 'welfare': 'public', 'game': 'cynical'}",0,0

""My sense is that it's going to take an as-yet-unimagined technical breakthrough to definitively put a stop to this.""Blurred lines between fact and fiction are among the factors that are ""jeopardizing the right to information,"" RSF reported, along with the ""arbitrary, payment-based approach to information"" that Twitter CEO Elon Musk has pushed, charging $8 per month for verified accounts which were once given to users including news outlets that had demonstrated merit. Both developments are turning social media platforms into ""quicksand for journalism,"" said RSF.The report was released two days after NewsGuard published its own analysis, Rise of the Newsbots: AI-Generated News Websites Proliferating Online. That report showed that along with artificial intelligence (AI) companies that create fake images, dozens of websites populated entirely with AI-generated content have begun to ""churn out vast amounts of clickbait articles to optimize advertising revenue.""""In April 2023, NewsGuard identified 49 websites spanning seven languages—Chinese, Czech, English, French, Portuguese, Tagalog, and Thai—that appear to be entirely or mostly generated by artificial intelligence language models designed to mimic human communication—here in the form of what appear to be typical news websites.""The websites publish hundreds of articles per day in some cases, about topics including politics, health, and finance—without ever disclosing their ownership or control or ensuring a human employee reads the information before it's shared with millions of internet users. The lack of human input led at least one of the inauthentic websites analyzed by NewsGuard, CelebrityDeaths.com, to publish a false obituary of U.S. President Joe Biden in April, which stated that Vice President Kamala Harris was acting as president before continuing, ""I'm sorry, I cannot complete this prompt as it goes against OpenAI's use case policy on generating misleading content.""OpenAI is the company behind ChatGPT, currently the fastest-growing app in the world. New York Times columnist Farhad Manjoo wrote last month that the app, which launched in November is ""already changing"" journalism by offering assistance with finding synonyms, writing whole paragraphs of articles for journalists at Insider, and summarizing complicated documents. ""In short, as numerous and more powerful AI tools have been unveiled and made available to the public in recent months, concerns that they could be used to conjure up entire news organizations—once the subject of speculation by media scholars—have now become a reality,"" said NewsGuard.RSF wrote that the challenges posed by AI and fake content—both for journalists and news consumers—are compounding ""volatility"" in the world of journalism, where reporters around the globe are also still in danger of being imprisoned, persecuted, or murdered for their work.Threats to press freedom were classified as ""problematic"" in 68 countries in the last year, ""difficult"" in 38 countries, and ""very serious"" in 20 countries. The safest countries for journalists were found to be Norway—in the top spot for the seventh year running—followed by Ireland and Denmark. Among the worst nations for press freedoms, according to the report: Vietnam, where independent reporters and commentators have been targeted and jailed by the government; China, the world's biggest jailer of journalists and a top source of propaganda and fake content, and North Korea.""The World Press Freedom Index shows enormous volatility in situations, with major rises and falls and unprecedented changes, such as Brazil's 18-place rise and Senegal's 31-place fall,"" said RSF Secretary-General Christiophe Deloire.

42,Biden,2023-05-06,"""Right-Wing Policy Is the Cause of the Crisis at the Border""","I recently came across a tweet from Stephen Miller, Donald Trump’s architect of the absolutely unconscionable family separation policy at the border. The tweet reads, “Joe Biden is the trafficker-in-chief. No one on earth is responsible for more child trafficking than Joe Biden.” This tweet is absurd on its face because Joe Biden is not actively engaging in human trafficking, unlike Governors Ron DeSantis of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas, who have utilized public funds and fraud to send migrants to Martha’s Vineyard and Vice President Kamala Harris’ home, using people who have fled from desperate situations as human props. Even though this tweet is ridiculous, it is useful because it perfectly encapsulates the conservative narrative on immigration. As immigrant advocates and progressives, we need to understand their narrative and have a clear recognition that it is completely backward. They will tell you that some fictitious “open border” policy is the cause of the crisis at the border, but the reality is that right wing policies in different areas overlap to create the perfect storm where people are desperately fleeing their home countries, only to be turned away by the U.S. and forced to cross the border in a dangerous manner.Miller’s narrative essentially boils down to this: Joe Biden’s “open border” policies make it too easy for people to come to the U.S., which causes human trafficking. This is illogical on its face because people would not resort to using “coyotes” to get themselves and their loved ones into the U.S. if they had a practical and legal method to immigrate, and they wouldn’t be so desperate to escape in the first place if there weren’t so many dangerous situations at home. The many disruptions in their home countries caused by right-wing U.S. policy, coupled with the lack of a legal option for immigrating to the U.S., are the principal causes of the crisis at the border.The 1-2 Punch Causing the Border Crisis: Disruption at Home and Militarized U.S. Border PolicyA useful thought experiment would be to ask yourself this question: What kind of situation would you have to be in that would cause you to flee from your home country through dangerous conditions, only to arrive in a foreign country that may or may not take you in? It is helpful to keep this in mind because it counters the traditional right wing thinking that people arriving at the southern border are “bad hombres” as Donald Trump famously put it. I would argue that most people would only leave their lives behind and embark on this journey if they felt like they had no other option.President Biden’s record on immigration has been mixed at best, but there is one policy he is pursuing that has the potential to help alleviate the crisis at the border.Why do citizens of countries like El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Haiti, and many others, feel like they have to leave their home countries? U.S. policies have disrupted the affairs of these countries for years in numerous ways. For example, the right wing U.S. Supreme Court effectively gave the green light to unlimited gun sales through its decision in D.C. v. Heller. Many of these guns flow south to our neighboring countries, where criminals and gangs use them to commit violence against the citizenry. This “iron river” has created a situation where nearly 70% of the guns recovered from crimes in Mexico are U.S. sourced. That number is a staggering 80% in the Caribbean. Organized crime and gang violence are a significant cause of people fleeing their home countries. They are made much deadlier by U.S. weapons manufactured and sold under the current, conservative interpretation of the 2nd amendment.Another example of right-wing U.S. policy causing people to flee their home countries is climate change induced drought and hurricanes. The U.S. is the biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gasses, meaning that most of the extra global warming causing gas in the atmosphere came from the U.S. Instead of embracing a Green New Deal that would transition us off fossil fuels and create good jobs, the U.S. has continuously ignored the urgency of climate change and doubled down on fossil fuel production. Climate change intensifies weather patterns like droughts and hurricanes, causing crop failure, property damage, and extreme poverty. Relentless droughts and hurricanes in Central America drove large numbers of people to flee their home countries recently. This will only continue to get worse until the U.S. adopts a progressive climate change policy and begins to reverse the damage already being done.A final example of right-wing U.S. policy causing people to flee their home countries is political interference. The U.S. has a long history of manipulating the political processes of Latin American countries in order to install leaders that are friendly to the U.S. and U.S. business interests. In the infamous “Roosevelt Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, Theodore Roosevelt asserted that the U.S. had the right to intervene in the affairs of our neighbors to the south. This concept has never disappeared from U.S. policy.In El Salvador, the U.S. propped up a repressive government that took power through a coup in 1979. This government killed its own citizens, causing a mass exodus to the U.S. Many of these refugees were later deported back to El Salvador, where they brought the U.S. gang culture with them back home, leading to the explosion of gang violence by MS-13. In Honduras, former President Obama and then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tacitly allowed and refused to condemn the coup of reformist President Manuel Zelaya, which paved the way for a repressive government that was actively involved in drug trafficking, most notably under former President Juan Orlando Hernández. Finally, U.S. sanctions on Venezuela have crippled that country’s economy, while U.S. attempts to overthrow its leftist government, most notably when former President Trump and John Bolton attempted to install Juan Guaidó as the leader by officially recognizing him as President in 2019, have created long term political and social instability. There are many more examples I could give, but the point should be clear that many of the policies championed by conservatives create the destabilizing conditions that cause people to flee their home countries and seek refuge at the southern border. “America first” is essentially a euphemism for, “We don’t care what happens to our neighbors to the south.”“Tougher” Immigration Laws create more illegal ImmigrationThe second part of the problem is that migrants at the southern border do not have a better way to come to the U.S. because of our militarized border and immigration policy. If they had a legal, safe, and humane way to come to the U.S., I am certain they would prefer to use that method instead of crossing the southern deserts, hoping not to die of thirst and heat exhaustion, or fall prey to kidnappers, cartels, and gangs. This is where Miller’s narrative falls apart. Human trafficking happens because our immigration policies make it essentially impossible for people seeking refuge to come to the U.S. in a normalized manner. Migrants at the border without a practical way to enter the U.S. hire “coyotes” or other smugglers to help get them or their loved ones across the border safely. This creates a human rights catastrophe that could be avoided if we stopped treating migrants like an invading army and started treating them like people who need help.If the situation in their home country is desperate enough, people are going to try to seek refuge however they can. Let’s think back to the thought experiment above. If there was a gang menacing your family, and your options were to stay at home and wait to be killed, or cross the U.S. border without documentation to ask for asylum, what would you do? Now ask yourself this, if you were fleeing for your life, would you rather come to the U.S. by showing up at a port of entry at the border and being lawfully admitted into the country, or would you rather cross the desert and hope to get caught by Border Patrol so you can be detained and ask for asylum? Clearly, anyone in this situation would rather come to the U.S. in a lawful, orderly fashion if they could, but absent such a way to come to the U.S., they are going to choose crossing the border any way they can instead of staying at home and facing death.President Biden’s record on immigration has been mixed at best, but there is one policy he is pursuing that has the potential to help alleviate the crisis at the border. He has begun using his authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act, section 212(d)(5)(A) to allow migrants at the southern border into the U.S. under “humanitarian parole”. Congress unambiguously gave the President the authority to “parole,” i.e., to allow people to enter the U.S., for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. President Biden has directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin allowing migrants into the U.S. using this authority as they seek refuge from dangerous situations back home.As the Center for American Progress details, this parole program has already been shown to reduce the number of encounters with people crossing the border illegally. The data clearly shows that if you give people a way to come to the U.S. legally, they will do so, which will improve the lives of migrants at the border and reduce human trafficking. Unfortunately, President Biden is coupling this parole program with restrictions on asylum. It seems that Democratic administrations can never fully embrace immigration and always try to have it both ways by opening new avenues to help immigrants on the one hand, while simultaneously shutting down others. The Biden Administration should keep access to asylum open while also implementing new ways for people to apply for humanitarian parole instead of opening one door while closing another.Miller’s implied argument that “weak” immigration laws cause human trafficking is false. In fact, the “tough” approach that conservatives support is largely to blame. We need to push back on the conservative narrative that immigration is a bad thing, and that the militarized approach of the GOP on immigration is helpful. The next time you engage with someone who uses this narrative, ask them why they support policies that cause people to flee their home countries, and why they support policies that force them to cross the border without documentation instead of giving them a safe way to seek refuge.",Common Dreams,Business,Yes,66.47906734084458,92.2642973405512,8.66156851504037,90.9504384377065,74.09139538350213,0.0,wing policy,{'wing': 'right'},"{'policy': 'militarized', 'trafficking': 'human', 'funds': 'public', 'situations': 'dangerous', 'props': 'human', 'narrative': 'conservative', 'advocates': 'immigrant', 'recognition': 'clear', 'border': 'southern', 'wing': 'right', 'areas': 'different', 'storm': 'perfect', 'manner': 'normalized', 'ones': 'loved', 'method': 'practical', 'place': 'first', 'disruptions': 'many', 'option': 'other', 'causes': 'principal', 'thought': 'useful', 'conditions': 'destabilizing', 'country': 'foreign', 'thinking': 'traditional', 'hombres': 'bad', 'people': 'most', 'others': 'many', 'ways': 'new', 'light': 'green', 'sales': 'unlimited', '%': 'staggering', 'crime': 'organized', 'cause': 'significant', 'interpretation': 'conservative', 'amendment': '2nd', 'emitter': 'historical', 'warming': 'global', 'gas': 'causing', 'jobs': 'good', 'poverty': 'extreme', 'droughts': 'relentless', 'numbers': 'large', 'example': 'final', 'interference': 'political', 'history': 'long', 'processes': 'political', 'countries': 'american', 'government': 'leftist', 'citizens': 'own', 'term': 'long', 'instability': 'political', 'examples': 'more', 'part': 'second', 'way': 'safe', 'deserts': 'southern', 'exhaustion': 'thirst', 'smugglers': 'other', 'rights': 'human', 'army': 'invading', 'experiment': 'thought', 'fashion': 'orderly', 'parole': 'humanitarian', 'reasons': 'humanitarian', 'benefit': 'public', 'administrations': 'democratic', 'avenues': 'new', 'argument': 'implied', 'laws': 'weak', 'approach': 'militarized', 'thing': 'bad', 'time': 'next'}",0,1

Today’s power plant pollution regulations are an important step, but pale in comparison to the United States’ massive expansion of oil and gas production. “Legitimizing the fossil fuel industry’s fantasies of ‘carbon capture’ and ‘clean hydrogen’ co-firing at scale is a harmful choice by the EPA.

However, he noted, ""United pilots want the company and the public to know that the bold 'United Next' growth plans cannot work without an updated pilot contract.""""This old pilot contract impacts our ability to maintain a healthy work-life balance.""The action by United pilots comes in the wake of a pair of successful strike-authorization votes by pilots at other airlines.On May 1, 95% of American Airlines pilots voted to authorize a strike. (Of the airline's 15,000 pilots, 96% participated, with 99% expressing support for a possible strike).""We will strike if necessary to secure the industry-leading contract that our pilots have earned and deserve—a contract that will position American Airlines for success,"" said Capt. Ed Sicher, president of the Allied Pilots Association. ""Our pilots' resolve is unmistakable. We will not be deterred from our goal of an industry-leading contract.""""The strike-authorization vote is one of several steps APA has taken to prepare for any eventuality and use all legal avenues available to us for contract improvement and resolution,"" Sicher noted. ""The best outcome is for APA and management to agree on an industry-leading contract—achieved through good-faith bargaining—benefiting our pilots, American Airlines, and the passengers we serve.""On Thursday, 97% of Southwest pilots voted to authorize a strike. (Of the airline's 10,000-plus pilots, 98% participated, with 99% expressing support for a possible strike).""This is a historic day, not only for our pilots but for Southwest Airlines,"" said Capt. Casey Murray, president of the Southwest Airlines Pilots Association. ""The lack of leadership and the unwillingness to address the failures of our organization have led us to this point. Our pilots are tired of apologizing to our passengers.""Murray and other union leaders have attributed Southwest's meltdown last winter to executives' yearslong refusal to invest in much-needed technological upgrades despite benefiting from billions of dollars in federal aid during the first two years of the Covid-19 pandemic.""We want our passengers to understand that we do not take this path lightly,"" Murray said Thursday. ""We want our customers to be prepared for the path ahead and make arrangements on other carriers so that their plans through the summer and fall are not disrupted.""United's 14,000 pilots could be next in line to vote on strike authorization.As The Associated Press reported Saturday, ""Pilots at all three carriers are looking to match or beat the deal that Delta Air Lines reached with its pilots earlier this year, which raised pay rates by 34% over four years.""""United has proposed to match the Delta increase, but that might not be enough for a deal,"" AP observed. Citing Thompson, the outlet noted that ""discussion about wages has been held up while the two sides negotiate over scheduling, including the union’s wish to limit United's ability to make pilots work on their days off.""The nation's pilots ""are unlikely to strike anytime soon, however,"" AP reported. ""Federal law makes it very difficult for unions to conduct strikes in the airline industry, and the last walkout at a U.S. carrier was more than a decade ago.""""Under U.S. law, airline and railroad workers can't legally strike, and companies can't lock them out, until federal mediators determine that further negotiations are pointless,"" the outlet explained. It continued:The National Mediation Board rarely declares a dead end to bargaining, and even if it does, there is a no-strikes ""cooling-off"" period during which the White House and Congress can block a walkout. That's what President Bill Clinton did minutes after pilots began striking against American in 1997. In December, President Joe Biden signed a bill that Congress passed to impose contract terms on freight railroad workers, ending a strike threat.Regardless of the legal hurdles to a walkout, unions believe that strike votes give them leverage during bargaining, and they have become more common. A shortage of pilots is also putting those unions in particularly strong bargaining position.Although Congress is highly unlikely to permit an airline strike, disgruntled pilots could still cause disruption through ""work to rule,"" Arthur Wheaton, director of labor studies at Cornell University, told AP.""They could say, 'We're not working any overtime,'"" said Wheaton. ""I don't anticipate the pilots trying to screw up travel for everybody intentionally, but bargaining is about leverage and power... having the ability to do that can be a negotiating tactic.""",Common Dreams,Business,Yes,65.55080273714105,99.59292514480012,98.62432112500431,77.0369016236727,71.02836653564354,83.20773841521194,united pilots,{'counterparts': 'american'},"{'promises': 'empty', 'duty': 'off', 'airports': 'major', 'pay': 'higher', 'practices': 'humane', 'management': '""united', 'negotiations': 'further', 'thing': 'right', 'system': 'antiquated', 'standards': 'leading', 'aviators': 'future', 'pilots': 'disgruntled', 'cwa': '@afa', 'backing': 'full', 'union': 'international', 'year': 'fifth', 'success': 'resounding', 'times': 'worst', 'history': 'recent', 'picket': 'informational', 'minute': 'last', 'day': 'historic', 'reassignments': 'abrupt', 'days': 'planned', 'contract': 'leading', 'balance': 'healthy', 'manner': 'professional', 'schedules': 'aggressive', 'plans': 'bold', 'votes': 'successful', 'airlines': 'other', 'strike).""we': 'possible', 'steps': 'several', 'avenues': 'available', 'outcome': 'best', 'faith': 'good', 'leaders': 'other', 'winter': 'last', 'refusal': 'yearslong', 'upgrades': 'technological', 'aid': 'federal', 'years': 'first', 'carriers': 'other', 'law': 'federal', 'walkout': 'last', 'mediators': 'federal', 'end': 'dead', 'hurdles': 'legal', 'position': 'strong', 'tactic': 'negotiating'}",0,0

88,Biden,2023-05-14,"""Beware: Ron DeSantis' Attack on Voting Rights Won't Stay in Florida""","In an increasingly unsafe and, frankly, unhinged America, one of the things that keeps me up at night is the question of whether Governor Ron DeSantis’s far-right Florida will ultimately serve as a model for a national Republican Party in charge of the entire federal government. (Legislative and executive branches aside, of course no political party is technically supposed to control the ostensibly nonpartisan judicial branch. But we all know how that’s going.)The competition is stiff this year, with Idaho, Tennessee, and more recently (and somewhat surprisingly) Montana all making strong bids for the title. But how can anyone compete with a state governed by a man so rabidly “anti-woke” that he has declared war on Mickey Mouse, a major source of tourism dollars?I think it’s safe to say no state has surpassed Florida in the practical implementation of authoritarian governance, which DeSantis has pulled off with the help of both a rubber-stamp GOP supermajority in the state legislature and a peculiar knack for stacking the bureaucracy with right-wing Christian ideologues who have no qualms about imposing their hyper-partisan will in areas like healthcare and education.In his “war on woke,” DeSantis has shattered pre-existing norms, brazenly politicizing the Florida Board of Medicine as he attacked transgender Floridians and appointing Christopher Rufo – the right-wing activist who started the “critical race theory” panic – to the board of trustees of New College of Florida, a sometime quirky state liberal arts college known as a haven for queer Florida youth that is now being transformed into an ideologically driven indoctrination center.No state has surpassed Florida in the practical implementation of authoritarian governance, which DeSantis has pulled off with the help of both a rubber-stamp GOP supermajority in the state legislature and a peculiar knack for stacking the bureaucracy with right-wing Christian ideologuesJust last week, Florida passed two new authoritarian laws. One is a bathroom bill affecting schools, government buildings, prisons, and detention centers that imposes criminal “trespassing” charges on those who use a bathroom that does not correspond to their sex according to “chromosomes, naturally occurring sex hormones, and internal and external genitalia present at birth”. The other is a medical “conscience” bill that began as a way to protect healthcare practitioners opposed to public health mandates set during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, but that will also allow providers to refuse to provide treatment based on their personal beliefs, i.e. to discriminate against queer and especially trans people. And on top of that, for good measure, the Florida state senate passed a downright asinine resolution urging the United States Congress to stop the military from pursuing diversity initiatives and being too “woke” in matters of personnel.DeSantis touts his approach to Florida as a “blueprint” for remaking the United States, and there is no doubt the Republican base adores his penchant for political theatre and misusing government to “own the libs” and punish the marginalized.But more sophisticated Republicans – including key members of the all-important donor class – have begun to hesitate about backing DeSantis, worried (correctly) that his hard right social policies are alienating to independent voters, who trended Democrat in 2022 over abortion, leading to the underperforming of Republican candidates relative to historical tendencies. Some also accuse DeSantis of a lack of “people skills,” failing to return phone calls to donors and state legislators, and there is clearly a severe charisma gap between DeSantis and Donald Trump.Of course, DeSantis – still officially undeclared for the 2024 primaries but also Trump’s only serious competition for the Republican Party’s nomination for the presidency – need not be elected for a Republican president and Republican-controlled congress to try and implement much of what he has done in Florida. And one of his policies is particularly worrisome in that regard: his mobilization of an ‘Office of Election Crimes and Security’ – essentially a brand new sort of election police – to terrorize individuals whose votes were retroactively deemed illegal.As I’ve belaboured before, America’s political system is broken in ways that favour Republicans, who have also shown in recent years they will always choose power over democracy. Republicans have often been able to win the presidency while losing the popular vote for president in recent election cycles, because, through a system known as the Electoral College, the American system counts states’ ‘votes’ for president rather than individuals’, meaning that in most states, the votes of those in the minority end up having no impact on the presidential race. Where Republicans control state governments, they also engage in voter suppression and gerrymandering in order to give themselves unfair advantages. Republicans also regularly push a false narrative that America is wracked with widespread “voter fraud,” and it was this narrative that fueled the 6 January insurrection, which was centred on the bald-faced lie that then president-elect Joe Biden had somehow “stolen” the election from Trump.Oddly enough, the 2018 Florida gubernatorial election in which DeSantis beat Democratic challenger Andrew Gillum was affected by voter suppression, but it also saw the passage of a state constitutional amendment widely touted as a win for democracy: the re-enfranchisement of convicted felons who have completed their sentences, including parole or probation. Previously, Florida banned all convicted felons from voting. After 2018, those restrictions were lifted except for those convicted of murder or sexual crimes. And this is where things get messy.Between their founding in April 2022 and January 2023, DeSantis’s election police made a total of 24 arrests of people who had voted illegally, but almost certainly without the intent to do so, in the 2020 election – an election in which over 11 million Floridians voted. In at least some cases these rehabilitated felons were issued voter cards by the state, which is an obvious indication that they voted in good faith, and that, if anyone is liable for the error, it should be the Florida state government. Nevertheless, out of the blue, DeSantis sent in his shiny new force to disrupt and destroy the lives they had rebuilt. Despite the fact that these election police clearly have almost nothing to do, DeSantis and the state legislature have moved to increase their budget.Some of these arrests led to plea deals that resulted in no jail time, while six have been dismissed by the courts, according to reporting by Lori Rosza for The Washington Post. DeSantis and his supporters presumably want convictions, since gratuitous cruelty is a hallmark of fascist politics – and indeed, the state legislature has obligingly moved to give the statewide prosecutor jurisdiction over ‘voter fraud’ cases in order to stop courts from dismissing cases on jurisdictional grounds, as several have done to date. But the arrests need not result in convictions for the possibility of being arrested for voting to have a deterrent effect among e.g. African-American communities – precisely the kinds of communities whose voting Republicans seek to suppress.Rosza’s reporting covers the case of Peter Washington, who was issued a voter ID card before he went to cast his vote for Biden. Per Rosza’s description, Washington “knows now he can’t vote – unless he applies for and receives clemency – but he’s telling others they should be wary of it, too, even if they don’t have a criminal record. One of his adult children has already decided he won’t be casting a ballot. A friend is doubting it, too.”Thinking nationally again, with respect to 2024 and beyond, the possibility that a future Republican president might create a national voting police force is terrifying. The fiction of a ‘voter fraud’ crisis Republicans already use to mobilise voters and stir up fear and outrage is plenty damaging; 6 January amply illustrates that point. But imagine the creation of federal machinery to enforce that phoney narrative through state terror, and the impact that would have on voting throughout the United States. It may seem far-fetched, but DeSantis is already engaging in state terror in Florida. And if Republicans had to worry less about their base’s preferred culture wars policies alienating voters, the donor class would have little incentive to shy away from culture warriors like DeSantis. And that’s what really keeps me up at night.",Common Dreams,Business,Yes,65.55080273714105,99.06291890070408,85.26665166718307,77.0369016236727,98.04398359430712,72.26565513215485,ron desantis,{},"{'government': 'federal', 'branches': 'legislative', 'party': 'political', 'branch': 'judicial', 'bids': 'strong', 'source': 'major', 'implementation': 'practical', 'governance': 'authoritarian', 'knack': 'peculiar', 'wing': 'right', 'ideologues': 'christian', 'will': 'partisan', 'norms': 'existing', 'activist': 'wing', 'theory': 'critical', 'college': 'quirky', 'arts': 'liberal', 'youth': 'queer', 'center': 'driven', 'week': 'last', 'laws': 'authoritarian', 'charges': 'criminal', 'genitalia': 'internal', 'bill': 'medical', 'health': 'public', 'beliefs': 'personal', 'measure': 'good', 'resolution': 'asinine', 'base': 'republican', 'theatre': 'political', 'members': 'key', 'class': 'important', 'policies': 'social', 'voters': 'independent', 'candidates': 'relative', 'tendencies': 'historical', 'gap': 'severe', 'competition': 'serious', 'president': 'republican', 'sort': 'new', 'system': 'american', 'years': 'recent', 'vote': 'popular', 'cycles': 'recent', 'states': 'most', 'race': 'presidential', 'advantages': 'unfair', 'narrative': 'false', 'fraud': 'widespread', 'lie': 'faced', 'election': 'gubernatorial', 'challenger': 'democratic', 'amendment': 'constitutional', 'felons': 'rehabilitated', 'crimes': 'sexual', 'indication': 'obvious', 'faith': 'good', 'force': 'national', 'cruelty': 'gratuitous', 'politics': 'fascist', 'jurisdiction': 'statewide', 'grounds': 'jurisdictional', 'communities': 'american', 'record': 'criminal', 'machinery': 'federal', 'wars': 'preferred', 'incentive': 'little'}",0,1

Sales ex-gasoline were up 7.3% versus 5.1%. Walmart shares are trading at $151.81 versus $149.53 at the close yesterday. Oil prices have slightly dropped, awaiting the outcome of the debt limit talks. A successful agreement could bolster the prices. Yesterday, the inventory data showed a sharp build of 5.0 million barrels vs an expected draw of -1.2M barrels expected. The price moved higher by 2.78% (go figure).U.S. President Joe Biden is in Japan for the G7 meeting discussing key global issues, while the spotlight stays on the resolution of the debt ceiling talks back home. The President has expressed optimism, emphasizing that the U.S. ""will not default"" and citing ongoing negotiations with top Congress members. He is expected to return to Washington on Sunday to aid in reaching an agreement, which Republican leader Kevin McCarthy believes is feasible by the weekend. Despite guarded optimism, no formal resolution has been reached, and a potential government default looms as early as June 1.The day's economic agenda commences at 8:30 am with the release of the Canadian New Housing Price Index (NHPI) data. The forecast suggests a slight dip of -0.1%, compared to the previously recorded 0.0%. In the US at the same time, Unemployment Claims are expected to decrease to 254K from the previous count of 264K (the 4-week average was the highest since November 2021). The Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Index is also set to be unveiled with an anticipated improvement to -19.8 from a previous -31.3. Recall, the Empire manufacturing index fell sharply on Monday (to -31.8 from 10.8 in the previous month). At 9:05 am, remarks from FOMC Member Jefferson are scheduled, followed by FOMC Member Barr at 9:30 am.

Additionally, the Conference Board Leading Index on a month-on-month basis is expected to report a smaller decrease of -0.6%, an improvement from the previous -1.2%. FOMC Member Logan is also slated to speak during this hour. The sharp decline is forecasting a recession in the US going forward (nothing new). A tentative release of the Bank of Canada's (BOC) Financial System Review is on the docket, with no specific time provided. At 11:00 am, remarks from the Bank of Canada's Governor Macklem are scheduled, potentially shedding light on Canada's monetary policy direction.Overnight, in the Asian Pacific session disappointing labor market data for April was released. Jobs in the economy shrunk while the unemployment rate jumped higher (however, the unemployment remains near record lows so it is not all bad). Nevertheless, the data today in addition to the subdued wages data published yesterday, along with other indications showing some steam coming out from the Australian economy should give the Reserve Bank of Australia reason enough to pause at its upcoming June 6 meeting. New Zealand PPI was lower than expectations. In other news, Montana is the first US state to ban TicTok. The decision is expected to be challenged in the courts.

The currencies are seeing a rebound versus the greenback after the declines this week despite concerns about the US debt ceiling all week. Expectations for a tighter Fed, has been supportive of the USD this week (around 50% for a June hike with a higher percentage for July). As the deadline for the U.S. debt ceiling looms, ongoing talks between lawmakers remain unfruitful with a potential default mere days away. President Joe Biden and top House Republican Kevin McCarthy are inching closer to a potential arrangement to lift the $31.4 trillion borrowing limit for two years and cap spending. However, the deal is yet to be finalized and would need swift congressional approval to prevent the federal government from running out of funds by June 1.In the premarket for US stocks, the mood in the futures is pointing marginally higher following up the large move higher in the Nasdaq yesterday on the back of Nvidia's 24% move to the upside (earnings and forecasts beat expectations). The Dow meanwhile is looking to snap a 5-day decline today being up in pre-market trading. Today, the focus will be on the release of key inflation data and tracking the debt ceiling negotiations as the clock ticks.Speaking of which, many Federal Reserve officials are cautious but are also keenly awaiting the release of the Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index at 8:30 AM today, their preferred inflation measure (and other inflation and employment statistics before they meet again in mid-June). The recent economic data has traders reassessing forecasts for the Fed's future interest rate path (the odds-on-favorite is to have a hike between now and July), this upcoming release is of significant interest. Today,Core PCE Price Index month over month (m/m) is expected to remain consistent with previous estimates at 0.3%, suggesting stable inflation in the economy. Personal Income m/m is forecasted to report at 0.4%, indicating an improvement over the last estimate of 0.3%. Personal Spending m/m is expected to increase significantly to 0.4% compared to the last reported figure of 0.0%, signaling potential robust consumer behavior.Durable Goods Orders m/m are anticipated to decline to -1.0% from the previous estimate of 2.8% (revised from 3.2%), suggesting potential headwinds for the economy. The Core Durable Goods Orders m/m are forecasted to report at -0.1%, which is lower than the previous estimate of 0.2%, indicating a potential slowdown in the manufacturing sector.The Goods Trade Balance for April is expected to report a deficit of -85.6B, a slight worsening from the previous estimate of -84.6B.Later at 10 AM ET:Final University of Michigan Consumer Sentiment is expected to come in at 57.7 (same as flash estimate of 57.7). Last month was at 63.5.The Inflation Expectations are predicted to hold steady at 4.5%, in line with the flash release, down from 4.6%. The 5-year inflation flash was at 3.2%.which was up from 3.0% last monthGold prices, typically a safe-haven asset, are experiencing some volatility due to the uncertainties surrounding the debt ceiling talks. Despite an earlier dip, prices are now climbing, driven by a weaker dollar. Meanwhile, oil prices are also on the rise following discussions around a possible production cut by OPEC+. While Russia has downplayed further cuts, Saudi Arabia's Energy Minister urged caution, leading to a precarious sentiment in the oil market.IN the European session, ECB's Vujcic expressed concerns about persistent inflation momentum, doubting the possibility of achieving a 2% target within the next two years, despite earlier projections forecasting a return to this target by the second half of 2025, with updated projections and the next Eurozone Flash Inflation print due next week. The UK retail sales came in at 0.5% which is higher than the 0.3% expected and up from the -1.2% last month.Reminder, the US and most of Europe will be on the 3-day weekend which can influence market price action, especially with the debt ceiling talks still a key market theme.

Now, a group of high-profile industry leaders has issued a one-sentence statement effectively confirming those fears.Mitigating the risk of extinction from AI should be a global priority alongside other societal-scale risks such as pandemics and nuclear war.It was posted to the Center for AI Safety, an organization with the mission ""to reduce societal-scale risks from artificial intelligence,"" according to its website. Signatories are a who's who of the AI industry, including OpenAI chief executive Sam Altman and Google DeepMind head Demis Hassabis. Turing Award-winning researchers Geoffrey Hinton and Yoshua Bengio, considered by many to be the godfathers of modern AI, also put their names to it. It's the second such statement over the past few months. In March, Musk, Steve Wozniak and more than 1,000 others called for a six-month pause on AI to allow industry and public to effectively catch up to the technology. ""Recent months have seen AI labs locked in an out-of-control race to develop and deploy ever more powerful digital minds that no one – not even their creators – can understand, predict, or reliably control,"" the letter states.Though AI is not (likely) self-aware as some have feared, it already presents risks for misuse and harm via deepfakes, automated disinformation and more. The LLMs could also change the way content, art and literature are produced, potentially affecting numerous jobs. US President Joe Biden recently stated that ""it remains to be seen"" if AI is dangerous, adding ""tech companies have a responsibility, in my view, to make sure their products are safe before making them public... AI can help deal with some very difficult challenges like disease and climate change, but it also has to address the potential risks to our society, to our economy, to our national security."" In a recent White House meeting, Altman called for regulation of AI due to potential risks. With a lot of opinions floating around, the new, brief statement is mean to show a common concern around AI risks, even if the parties don't agree on what those are.""AI experts, journalists, policymakers, and the public are increasingly discussing a broad spectrum of important and urgent risks from AI,"" a preamble to the statement reads. ""Even so, it can be difficult to voice concerns about some of advanced AI’s most severe risks. The succinct statement below aims to overcome this obstacle and open up discussion. It is also meant to create common knowledge of the growing number of experts and public figures who also take some of advanced AI’s most severe risks seriously.""This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai-presents-risk-of-extinction-on-par-with-nuclear-war-industry-leaders-say-114025874.html?src=rss",Engadget,Technology,Yes,60.82563479847376,92.09883717173318,99.2183102352836,6.212486036953545,84.15628177902572,71.09295974685631,ai risk,{'war': 'nuclear'},"{'models': 'large', 'intelligence': 'artificial', 'profile': 'high', 'priority': 'global', 'risks': 'severe', 'scale': 'societal', 'war': 'nuclear', 'executive': 'chief', 'researchers': 'winning', 'statement': 'succinct', 'months': 'recent', 'minds': 'digital', 'disinformation': 'automated', 'jobs': 'numerous', 'challenges': 'difficult', 'security': 'national', 'meeting': 'recent', 'concern': 'common', 'spectrum': 'broad', 'knowledge': 'common', 'number': 'growing', 'figures': 'public'}",1,1

The MVP is a proposed 303-mile fracked-gas pipeline that would run through West Virginia and southwest Virginia and result in as much carbon pollution annually as 26 coal-fired power plants. Its approval was inserted into the agreement as a political favor from President Joe Biden to Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) in return for his vote for the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. An amendment to remove the MVP provisions was introduced by Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) in the Senate and Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan (D-VA) in the House of Representatives, and supported by the entire Virginia Democratic delegation, but neither effort was successful. The Fiscal Responsibility Act, which now awaits the President’s signature, declares that completion of the MVP “is required in the national interest.” It requires the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to issue all permits within 21 days of the law’s enactment and hamstrings other government agencies, bypassing their long-established environmental review processes. Finally, it prohibits courts from reviewing all pending and future permits for MVP. The bill also undercuts the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), undermining decades of environmental protections, and requires the President to approve a laundry list of fossil fuel projects every year through 2030. Victoria Higgins, Virginia Director for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, stated: “First, I want to express our heartfelt gratitude to Senator Kaine and Congresswoman McClellan for championing the effort to remove MVP from this bill. Today, we are grieving for the families in southwest Virginia who have fought this pipeline tooth and nail for eight years. Their home should not be sacrificed as a political favor. We are grieving for ourselves, and especially our young people, for whom this represents a huge step backwards in our urgent fight against climate change. Their future should not be a bargaining chip. And we are grieving for our lands and waters, cherished places which will now be less protected.""But let us be clear: more than anything, we are furious. We feel betrayed by the Biden administration, who transparently traded the people and land of Southwest Virginia for a vote. The President’s commitment to climate and environmental justice is merely rhetoric if he continues to approve massive new fossil fuel infrastructure and reduce and sidestep community and judicial review. We’re equally furious at the Republicans who threatened to drive our economy off the cliff to pursue their political ends. We will not take this lying down. Our fight against the Mountain Valley Pipeline is not over.”Chesapeake Climate Action Network has been involved in the fight to stop the Mountain Valley Pipeline since 2015 through organizing and legal action.

305,Biden,2023-06-05,"""The USD is the strongest and the GBP is the weakest as a North American session begins""","The USD is the strongest and the GBP is the weakest as the new trading week begins. The move to the upside comes after stronger US job gains on Friday, but with a higher unemployment rate as well. Over the weekend Saudi Arabia said they would cut production leading to a move higher in oil prices. US treasury yields are higher. Stocks are little changed/mixed.Overall, the up and down ranges in the major currency pairs are limited. For example, the EURUSD is only 25 pips. The NZDUSD range is only 26 pips, and the AUDUSD is only 31 pips. That is not a lot of price action. Oil prices are up by $1.70, buoyed by the Saudi Arabia announcement to slash oil production by around one million barrels per day starting from July. This decision aims to further tighten the oil market in the second half of the year. In tandem, the OPEC+ group, including allies like Russia, has agreed to lower overall production goals from January 2024. This strategic move is a bid to lend additional support to oil prices that have been on a downward trajectory due to concerns over a global economic slowdown.U.S. stock futures are little changed in the premarket trading. On Friday the major indices surged with the Dow Industrial Average rising over 700 points or 2.12% which was the largest increase since 2.13% back on January 6. The gains were spurred by the resolution of the debt ceiling stalemate and a robust May jobs report. Recall jobs showed an increase of 339,000 jobs last month (better than 190K estimate), but with the unemployment rate rising to 3.7% from 3.4%. The data has calmed fears of a looming recession and suggested a potential pause in the Federal Reserve's long-standing interest rate hikes.Shifting focus to the to China, the Caixin Services index accelerated in May, marking a fifth consecutive month of increase since COVID restrictions were eased earlier in 2023. The index came in at 57.1 versus 55.2 estimate and 56.4 last month. However, last week the manufacturing industry, a vital contributor to China's economy, showed signs of contraction, potentially signaling a slowdown in the country's post-pandemic recovery.For good order, President Joe Biden successfully averted a looming debt crisis by signing into law a bill that raised the nation's debt ceiling. This decisive action follows weeks of intense negotiations and global market unease. The bill effectively suspends the borrowing limit until 2025 and puts a cap on some government spending, thus staving off a potentially disastrous default.IN Europe this morning, CPI data in Switzerland was as expected, EU PPI showed continued weakness.German Trade Balance: EUR 18.4B, better than expectations of EUR 16.1B and higher than previous figure of EUR 14.9B.Swiss CPI m/m: 0.3%, meeting expectations and an improvement compared to the previous figure of 0.0%.EUR PPI: -3.2% which is lower than expectations of -3.0% and a further increase from the previous month -1.3 monthSentix Investor Confidence (EUR): -17.0, worse than expected -15.2 and a decrease from the previous months -13.1The monthly PMI services indices in EU and UK came in below expectations in the EU, with Spanish, Italian, French, German, and Eurozone Final Services PMIs all underperforming.

Both New York and Washington, D.C. canceled outdoor activities at public schools, New Jersey closed its state offices early, and the the Federal Aviation Administration slowed air traffic for New Jersey's Newark Liberty International Airport and New York City's LaGuardia Airport because of low visibility, as ABC News reported.

""This is not the day to train for a marathon,"" he said, as The New York Times reported. AccuWeather assessed that the smoke was the worst the Northeast had experienced in more than two decades. ""Unlike other wildfire smoke episodes in the Northeast, where the smoke was primarily present well above the ground, only resulting in hazy skies and more vivid sunrises and sunsets, the smoke in recent days has also been at ground level resulting in poor air quality, low visibility, and serious health risks to people, especially those outdoors,"" the outlet wrote in a media advisory. Wildfire smoke is a cause of particulate matter air pollution, which has been linked to a growing number of health hazards from heart and lung disease to poor mental health and cognitive decline. In the U.S. West, regular smoke from climate-fueled wildfires has begun to reverse policy-driven improvements in air quality, and now the East is beginning to see similar impacts. New York City's air quality on Wednesday was its worst since the 1960s, New York City health commissioner Ashwin Vasan said, according to The New York Times. AccuWeather, meanwhile, likened spending hours breathing the air in the hardest-hit Northeast cities to smoking five to 10 cigarettes. \u201cLive view of Lower Manhattan from @Earthcam as dense wildfire smoke settles in close to the surface.

""And it's important that you do everything you can to remain indoors during those high, high pollution episodes, and it's really important to keep an eye on your health or any development of symptoms."" The smoke is coming from more than 400 fires burning in Canada, as officials in that country said this year could be the worst for fires on record, the Independent reported. In the province of Quebec alone, more than 150 fires were burning as of Tuesday, with more than 110 out of control, forcing thousands to evacuate, CTV News Montreal reported. The climate crisis is fueling these fires with record spring heat, and high latitudes are warming faster than the global average, as The Washington Post pointed out. Already in May, Canada saw more than 6.5 million acres burn, far surpassing the average for the month of around 370,000 acres. ""These conditions this early in the season are unprecedented."" ""These conditions this early in the season are unprecedented and of course they are deeply concerning to all Canadians,"" Emergency Preparedness Minister Bill Blair told CBC News June 1. Smoke from the Quebec fires is being pushed south over the Great Lakes, Northeast, and Mid Atlantic by a clockwise low pressure system over Nova Scotia, The Washington Post reported further. It has drifted as far south as South Carolina and as far west as Minnesota. \u201cAs we continue to monitor the widespread smoke from wildfires in Canada, @NOAA's #GOESEast \ud83d\udef0\ufe0f can see some of it being swept up by a large swirling low pressure system.

""As bad as the smoke and air pollution was on Tuesday, the air quality can be even worse at times across parts of the Northeast on Wednesday and poor air quality is expected to linger in some areas into the weekend,"" AccuWeather chief meteorologist Jonathan Porter said. The location of the smoke could also change as the week progresses. “On Thursday and Friday, the worst smoke and related air quality is expected to shift west across the Great Lakes and parts of Ohio Valley and interior Northeast including the cities of Buffalo, Pittsburgh, and Detroit,"" AccuWeather director of forecasting Operation Dan DePodwin said. DePodwin warned that a system in the Ohio Valley region in the coming days or next week could turn into something called a ""smoke storm,"" causing the smoke ""to wrap westward across the Great Lakes and then southward through the Ohio Valley and into the mid-Atlantic."" While millions wait for the smoke to lift, climate activists pointed out that a change in political wind is really what is needed to prevent such extreme weather events.

383,Biden,2023-06-14,"""Fox News claims Biden’s Pride event promoted pedophilia by flying ‘Progress’ flag""","The right-wing outrage over the White House Pride event on Saturday is now reaching its fourth day. The event in past years has gone off without any outcry, but as a wave of anti-LGBTQ sentiment has swept the nation, this year's event was ripe for bad-faith backlash. Initially, critics claimed President Joe Biden was disrespecting the military by flying the Pride flag from the White House portico. They then denounced the event as a bacchanalia after an influencer flashed her chest. Now they're arguing the administration is outright promoting pedophilia by displaying the flag. A recent story on Fox News cited prominent critics within the anti-trans movement to support its claim Biden flew a ""controversial new transgender flag that promotes grooming and pedophilia."" In the piece, Fox News said the flag, dubbed the Progress Pride Flag and designed to include people of color and trans, intersex, and non-binary communities was ""an homage to the cult of pedophilia infecting many institutions."" Fox News quoted noted anti-trans activist Jaimee Michell of Gays Against Groomers, who claimed ""the flag represents to us an ideology, a political statement of indoctrinating kids and trans kids and pushing kids to sterilize and mutilate themselves."" Over the past several years, right-wingers have sought to demonize the trans community by calling them ""groomers,"" claiming that transgender individuals are pedophiles attempting to brainwash children, despite not providing any reasonable proof that kind of behavior is going on. Fox News' assertion the flag is pro-pedophilia was backed up by one source. Fox said the claim it is a ""pedophile flag"" was made in a TikTok by Black Guns Matter, noting the TikTok has since been deleted. Fox News went on to note that accusations the flag was secretly designed to promote pedophilia have repeatedly been debunked. The online backlash to Fox News' smearing of the flag and the trans community was swift. https://twitter.com/tobinjstone/status/1669051576269299731 ""Outright lies and dehumanization. This is why people are storming into Target stores threatening employees when Target has carried pride merch for years,"" wrote one critic, referencing the recent backlash against Target selling Pride merch, like it has always done. https://twitter.com/BenjaminJS/status/1669060451114823680 ""Fox News is promoting stochastic terrorism against the LGBTQ community. Pure and simple,"" said one person, highlighting how the right-wing fervor over trans rights has sparked armed protests and threats of violence against hospitals and schools. https://twitter.com/ChrisCJackson/status/1669067879742840841 https://twitter.com/jdbatts79/status/1669063654640164869 While most people were outraged by the story, some chose to have fun with it, joking that it was clear the White House didn't hoist a flag for the Catholic Church. Numerous right-wingers have reminded silent or indifferent as repeated pedophilia scandals have hit churches, instead focusing on things like drag shows. ""The Catholic Church has a flag?"" asked one user. https://twitter.com/NotLennyBruce/status/1669034636742381568 https://twitter.com/rules_of_izzy/status/1669062901720555520 Fox News did not immediately respond to request for comment. As the criticisms intensified, Fox News deleted the tweet and the story. While backlash to the White House Pride event continues, by other metrics, it was a wildly successful day. According to reports, it was the largest Pride event ever thrown at the White House, with over 1,000 people in attendance. Update 4:00pm CT: Fox News has since republished the article, with a new headline that removes the reference to pedophilia, instead claiming the flag ""troubles some critics in the gay community."" The claim that it is a ""pedophile flag"" remains in the piece. Sign up to receive the Daily Dot’s Internet Insider newsletter for urgent news from the frontline of online.

404,Biden,2023-06-15,"""Audio of Ron DeSantis saying ‘p*ssy’ is as unpleasant as you’d image""","Analysis The campaign trail is a candidate's chance to define or redefine their public image. Does the electorate think you're a prematurely elderly, out-of-touch religious zealot? Well, slip into some leather and hop on a motorcycle like former Vice President Mike Pence. Are you an unknown tech bro with presidential ambitions? Show up to a former president's arraignment and make a ham-handed attempt to grab headlines by demanding your rivals sign a pledge to pardon him. But what if you're Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R)? Thanks to Fox News and DeSantis' former status as the chief presidential suck-up, he's a known quantity. As with any candidate, this is both a positive and a negative. It certainly doesn't help matters that DeSantis is campaigning for the presidency with all the grace of a rabid porcupine. Not even the simple act of greeting a baby can make him come across as anything but ChatGPT pretending to converse with the hoi polloi. Assuming he's is not going to win many points on the likeability scale by eating pudding with his fingers (allegedly), inspiring ""pure hatred"" in his staff, and treating members of his own party (including donors) with the warmth of a White Walker, the best play is for DeSantis to do what comes naturally: attack, attack, attack. DeSantis relishes attacking his enemies, both real and imagined. Some might even say it's his kink. Just ask undocumented immigrants, transgender people, pregnant people, Disney, teachers, drag queens, and books. Today, Florida's governor set his sights on California Governor Gavin Newsom (D). DeSantis enjoys going after Newsom and California almost as much as he enjoys firing people. In his speech, DeSantis challenged Newsom to seek the Democratic presidential nomination and accused him of having a ""bizarre"" and ""serious fixation"" on Florida. ""What I would tell him is stop pussyfooting around,"" DeSantis said. ""Are you gonna throw your hat in the ring and challenge [President Joe Biden] ... or are you just gonna sit on the sidelines and chirp?"" https://www.twitter.com/therecount/status/1669382261400035328 (DeSantis was probably mad that Newsom called him a ""small, pathetic man"" for flying migrants to California on Floridian taxpayers' dimes.) Mature observers made points about the unlikelihood of Newsom running against Biden, DeSantis' own yearlong shadow campaign before his official announcement, and the fact that DeSantis' state might be big, but Newsom's is bigger. Less mature observers zeroed in on DeSantis saying the word ""pussy."" No, he was not talking about genitalia. No, he wasn't bragging about grabbing one. And, yes, he properly used the term ""pussyfooting."" There's just something deeply uncomfortable about hearing Governor Pudding Fingers say ""pussy."" https://twitter.com/XLAnimosity/status/1669417127944568851 Maybe it's his track record of policing vaginas. Maybe it's that absence of charm. Either way, DeSantis could do us all a favor and omit ""pussy"" from his stump speeches. For the children.

The far-right group was founded in late 2020 by current and former school board members in Florida who were pissed off about masks and vaccines for kids. The anger that forged Moms for Liberty has grown, as the organization expanded to become an overtly political operation. It even has multiple political action committees. Moms for Liberty’s online presence is set to seethe. The group calls members “joyful warriors,” which is ironic given all the things it hates: critical race theory, social-emotional learning, wokeness, transgender rights, antifa, President Joe Biden, sex ed, teachers—even the PTA. Yes, the PTA. Oh, Moms for Liberty says it loves teachers and just wants kids to get a good education. But actions speak louder than memes. Moms for Liberty claims that teachers unions “are destroying public education.” It calls the unions the “k12 cartel.” The group insists its crusade against books is about making sure kids are only exposed to age-appropriate materials. Yet time and again, it chooses to attack books about LGBTQ people and issues. Books about discrimination and racial equity don’t escape Moms for Liberty’s wrath, either. They don’t think kids should read Ruby Bridges Goes to School: My True Story, the tale of the first Black child to integrate schools in New Orleans. The group also called books about Martin Luther King Jr. too “divisive.” As its influence has grown, so has its notoriety. Members and chapter heads have been accused of harassing and threatening teachers and school board members all over the country. While Moms for Liberty insists it isn’t a harbinger of hate, the Southern Poverty Law Center saw enough festering rage to add it to the list of far-right anti-government extremist groups this year. Anger is good business, though. According to GuideStar, Moms for Liberty raked in $370,000 in 2021. Moms for Liberty is on Twitter, Facebook, YouTube, Instagram, and Truth Social. There’s a Telegram account that may belong to it as well. Dirtiest Delete Moms for Liberty began with a scorched earth campaign to get schools to reopen during the pandemic. Yet the Tennessee Holler reports that one of its chapters deleted a section on its website admitting that its goal is “to get as many kids out of public schools as possible.” It’s almost like Moms for Liberty hates public schools.

In numerous posts on Twitter, Facebook, and TikTok, far-right users are citing contextless videos of everything from tanks and helicopters as proof of a nefarious takeover plot. One account in particular, a Twitter user known as @WillingWitness, has been particularly effective in spreading such unproven claims. ""BREAKING NEWS! Military landing in suburban neighbors in Larksper California. Massive military movements being reported in multiple states,"" the user wrote. ""Anyone have more info on this, please post below. My contact that sent this video is local military and says it is NOT a drill."" https://twitter.com/WillingWitness/status/1670105895811051520?s=20 The video has since been seen more than 6 million times, sparking fear and paranoia among conspiracy theorists online. Yet the appearance of helicopters in California, in this case MV-22 Ospreys, is not unusual. As noted by journalist Tyler Rogoway, the helicopters are used to transport staff from the White House. The helicopters were filmed just days ahead of a planned visit to the area by President Joe Biden. ""HMX-1 MV-22s that ferry around WH staff and press pool,"" Rogoway wrote. ""Absolutely nothing abnormal here."" https://twitter.com/Aviation_Intel/status/1670159511544295426?s=20 Numerous other videos went viral as well. Broes also shared footage of so-called tanks on the highway in Idaho. The footage, which has garnered over 1.3 million shares since being posted, was similarly spread across social media. ""BREAKING NEWS!"" Broes tweeted. ""Tank group on the highway in Idaho falls today!"" https://twitter.com/WillingWitness/status/1670126273526628353?s=20 Once again, as now outlined in a Community Notes banner, the military equipment was not out of the ordinary. Local media reported earlier this month that the Idaho Army National Guard’s 1st of the 148th Field Artillery Regiment would be moving tracked vehicles along state roads on June 14. Traveling between the Idaho Falls Training Area and the Idaho Falls Armory, the military convoy was simply returning from an annual training event. In yet another example, an account notorious for spreading misinformation shared footage of military vehicles being shipped by train before describing the display as ""incomprehensible military activity."" https://twitter.com/Sprinter99880/status/1670488157647675396 Once again, it was revealed shortly after that the vehicles in question were actually being transported in Canada by the Canadian military, not in the U.S. Other conspiratorial accounts latched onto the trend by sharing supposedly new footage that was in fact years old. Prominent users such as Kim Dotcom, who regularly shares debunked information to his more than 1.4 million Twitter followers, helped spread the rumor that military activity had seen an uptick as if it were confirmed. ""There’s a significant spike in military activity inside the United States. Why?"" he questioned. https://twitter.com/KimDotcom/status/1670491576005693440?s=20 While many conspiracy theorists expressed concern, others were quick to point out that such military movements and training exercises are much more common than some have suggested. ""This means nothing. In my hometown there are train tracks that lead to a large US Army base,"" one commenter responded. ""If I recorded every time I saw vehicles being shipped by rail even back in pre-9/11 days I could have convinced someone that something major was about to go down."" The trend of pointing to footage of military movements as evidence of a domestic takeover is nothing new among conspiracy theorists. Back in 2015, conspiracy theorists in Texas became convinced that a military exercise known as ""Jade Helm"" was being used as cover for then-President Barack Obama to install himself as dictator. https://twitter.com/AdamKinzinger/status/1670521883203084288 ""Oh lord.

The investment, which was funded by the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, aims to give all Americans access to high-speed internet by 2030.Texas is getting the largest slice of funding with $3.3 billion. Eighteen other states are receiving over $1 billion, including Alabama, California, Georgia, Louisiana, Michigan, Missouri, North Carolina, Virginia and Washington. Every state is getting at least $107 million. Several US territories are included in the program, with $27 million allocated to the US Virgin Islands receiving and $334 million earmarked for Puerto Rico.""With these allocations and other Biden administration investments, all 50 states, DC and the territories now have the resources to connect every resident and small business to reliable, affordable high-speed internet by 2030,"" the White House said in a statement.Last year, the White House announced an initiative that would allocate at least $100 million to each state through the Broadband Equity, Access and Deployment (BEAD) Program. The remainder of the funding was on hold until the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) drew up a more detailed coverage map showing which homes and businesses lacked high-speed internet access. The funding will be allocated based on the map.The FCC released its first draft of the overhauled map, which incorporates more granular data, in November. Still, politicians on both sides of the aisle were concerned it left out millions of businesses and homes and urged the White House to delay the broadband funding efforts until issues were resolved.After taking feedback from the public and states, the FCC unveiled an updated version in May. According to The Washington Post, the updated map addressed around 4 million mistakes, resulting in approximately half a million more homes, businesses and other locations without any internet access being identified. In all, the FCC determined that more than 8.3 million homes and businesses lack access to high-speed internet.States will first focus on bringing broadband to locations that have no access at all. If they have any funding left over, they can use it to improve internet access for those with slow speeds.It could take up to two years for the government to dole out all the funding. States, Washington DC and other territories will have until the end of the year to submit their initial proposals for how to run their grant programs. Once the Department of Commerce’s National Telecommunications and Information Administration approves the initial plans, states will be able to request access to at least 20 percent of their allocation. However, they might not obtain access to all of their funds until the plans are finalized, which may take until 2025, according to Reuters. Many of the locations that lack broadband access are in rural areas. By and large, major providers have shied away from rolling out broadband in these locales due to their smaller populations and the high cost of installing infrastructure.Update 6/26 12:06PM ET: Added details about the fundingThis article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/the-biden-administrations-42-billion-broadband-program-is-finally-getting-underway-143625721.html?src=rss",Engadget,Technology,Yes,65.4125212509436,27.328055807715348,93.00161772179035,74.96423339822121,57.55075082919714,31.62248737761672,biden administration,{},"{'speed': 'high', 'slice': 'largest', 'states': 'other', 'territories': 'other', 'investments': 'other', 'business': 'small', 'internet': 'affordable', 'year': 'last', 'map': 'updated', 'draft': 'first', 'data': 'granular', 'version': 'updated', 'locations': 'other', 'speeds': 'slow', 'proposals': 'initial', 'plans': 'initial', 'areas': 'rural', 'providers': 'major', 'populations': 'smaller', 'cost': 'high', 'details': 'added'}",0,0

BEAD was created in 2021 under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act. Alongside the FCC’s Affordable Connectivity Program (ACP), BEAD will cover some of the costs of making broadband available and affordable to unserved and underserved communities. BEAD money will be distributed in all 50 states and U.S. territories to locally available access providers. Free Press Co-CEO Craig Aaron, who attended today’s White House event, said: “Today’s funding announcement marks an important step toward fulfilling Congress’ commitment to close the digital divide — and makes it more likely that those new high-speed internet services will be more affordable. We applaud the White House and Congress for supporting universal access and are grateful this investment is going out the door. BEAD funding marks an important recognition that broadband should be treated as an essential utility that must be affordable to everyone in the United States. “The NTIA recognized that deployment of fiber infrastructure is the best way to maximize this public investment. The NTIA also sent a strong message to states that restrict municipal broadband deployment, encouraging them to waive those limits. Letting communities determine their own path forward is a big part of guaranteeing the internet for all. The agency also requires recipients of BEAD money to provide affordable, low-cost options to subscribers they will serve.“While there’s much to celebrate today, we can’t ignore the need for additional funding to support the FCC’s Affordable Connectivity Program, which was created under the same statute as the BEAD program. Close to 19 million households are enrolled in the FCC program right now, and enrollment numbers are only going up. If Congress fails to invest more funding in the ACP, millions of people could lose affordable access to high-speed internet services, including networks the BEAD program will fund.”",Common Dreams,Business,Yes,65.4125212509436,54.14297807242912,71.41971068361921,74.96423339822121,57.55075082919714,31.62248737761672,white house,{},"{'details': 'important', 'funding': 'more', 'access': 'affordable', 'speed': 'high', 'infrastructure': 'robust', 'areas': 'rural', 'service': 'adequate', 'money': 'bead', 'providers': 'available', 'step': 'important', 'divide': 'digital', 'services': 'new', 'recognition': 'important', 'utility': 'essential', 'way': 'best', 'investment': 'public', 'message': 'strong', 'deployment': 'municipal', 'path': 'own', 'part': 'big', 'options': 'affordable', 'cost': 'low', 'statute': 'same'}",0,0

They’re some of the most special things about our country” said Ellen Montgomery, Public Lands Campaign Director for Environment America. “It’s appropriate that so many weighed in for protecting our forests so close to July 4th. On summer and holiday weekends, people spend more time hiking and camping in our forests and realize again how important they are.” On Earth Day 2022, President Joe Biden issued an executive order calling on the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management to inventory and conserve mature and old growth forests on federal land. The BLM’s rulemaking, which includes a request for feedback on how the “BLM [might] use this rule to foster ecosystem resilience of old and mature forests on BLM lands” is a step forward in implementing the president’s directives on forest conservation. “Unfortunately, many forests managed by the BLM are threatened by logging,” continued Montgomery. “We hope that the BLM will follow President Biden’s direction and listen to the 330,000 plus people who weighed in. The agency should move quickly to protect our biggest oldest trees.” Dozens of organizations, many of which are members of the Climate Forests Campaign submitted comments.

In a decision announced Monday, the European Commission approved the Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework. Under the terms of the deal, the US will establish a court Europeans can engage with if they feel a US tech platform violated their data privacy rights. President Joe Biden announced the creation of the Data Protection Review Court in an executive order he signed last fall. The court can order the deletion of user data and impose other remedial measures. The framework also limits access to European user data by US intelligence agencies.The Trans-Atlantic Data Privacy Framework is the latest chapter in a saga that is now more than a decade in the making. It was only earlier this year the EU fined Meta a record-breaking €1.2 billion after it found that Facebook's practice of moving EU user data to US servers violated the bloc's digital privacy laws. The EU also ordered Meta to delete the data it already had stored on its US servers if the company didn't have a legal way to keep that information there by the fall. As TheWall Street Journal notes, Monday's agreement should allow Meta to avoid the need to delete any data, but the company may end up still paying the fine.Even with a new agreement in place, it probably won't be smooth sailing just yet for the companies that depend the most on cross-border data flows. Max Schrems, the lawyer who successfully challenged the previous Safe Harbor and Privacy Shield agreements that governed transatlantic data transfers before today, told The Journal he plans to challenge the new framework. ""We would need changes in US surveillance law to make this work and we simply don't have it,"" he said. For what it's worth, the European Commission says it's confident it can defend its new framework in court.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/new-privacy-deal-allows-us-tech-giants-to-continue-storing-european-user-data-on-american-servers-214347975.html?src=rss",Engadget,Technology,Yes,62.103918376676106,34.81936756329716,99.83784546556969,25.37237380293546,79.35392781487633,77.77346006970677,privacy deal,"{'deal': 'new', 'data': 'european', 'servers': 'american'}","{'e': 'transatlantic', 'users': 'european', 'soil': 'american', 'order': 'executive', 'fall': 'last', 'measures': 'remedial', 'data': 'border', 'chapter': 'latest', 'laws': 'digital', 'way': 'legal', 'agreement': 'new', 'sailing': 'smooth', 'agreements': 'previous', 'transfers': 'transatlantic', 'framework': 'new'}",0,0

The companies will voluntarily agree to abide by a number of principles though the agreement will expire when Congress passes legislation to regulate AI.The Biden administration has placed a focus on making sure that AI companies develop the technology responsibly. Officials want to make sure tech firms can innovate in generative AI in a way that benefits society without negatively impacting the safety, rights and democratic values of the public.In May, Vice President Kamala Harris met with the CEOs of OpenAI, Microsoft, Alphabet and Anthropic, and told them they had a responsibility to make sure their AI products are safe and secure. Last month, President Joe Biden met with leaders in the field to discuss AI issues.The tech firms have agreed to eight suggested measures concerning safety, security and social responsibility. Those include:Letting independent experts test models for bad behavior Investing in cybersecurityEmboldening third parties to discover security vulnerabilitiesFlagging societal risks including biases and inappropriate usesFocusing on research into the societal risks of AISharing trust and safety information with other companies and the government Watermarking audio and visual content to help make it clear that content is AI-generatedUsing the state-of-the-art AI systems known as frontier models to tackle society’s greatest problems""These commitments, which the companies have chosen to undertake immediately, underscore three principles that must be fundamental to the future of AI — safety, security, and trust — and mark a critical step toward developing responsible AI,"" the White House statement read. ""As the pace of innovation continues to accelerate, the Biden-Harris Administration will continue to remind these companies of their responsibilities and take decisive action to keep Americans safe.""The fact that this is a voluntary agreement underscores the difficulty that lawmakers have in keeping up with the pace of AI developments. Several bills have been introduced in Congress in the hope of regulating AI. One aims to prevent companies from using Section 230 protections to avoid liability for harmful AI-generated content, while another seeks to require political ads to include disclosures when generative AI is employed. Of note, administrators in the House of Representatives have reportedly placed limits on the use of generative AI in congressional offices.Update 7/21 5:47AM: This article has been updated to include a statement from the White House.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ai-companies-will-reportedly-commit-to-safeguards-at-the-white-houses-request-185646283.html?src=rss",Engadget,Technology,Yes,64.95574575258009,65.73311168268216,93.50755755315012,68.1177343645694,77.22137573002838,61.32175031506888,seven ai,{},"{'space': 'artificial', 'safeguards': 'certain', 'values': 'democratic', 'month': 'last', 'measures': 'suggested', 'responsibility': 'social', 'experts': 'independent', 'behavior': 'bad', 'parties': 'third', 'risks': 'societal', 'usesfocusing': 'inappropriate', 'companies': 'other', 'content': 'generated', 'commitments': 'problems""these', 'step': 'critical', 'action': 'decisive', 'agreement': 'voluntary', 'bills': 'several', 'ads': 'political', 'offices': 'congressional'}",0,1

Robert Oppenheimer and the Manhattan Project. In a tweet posted on Thursday, Alisa Lynn Valdés says that her mother was 18 months old when she lived in the fallout zone of the first atomic bomb in New Mexico. Valdés also says that her mother's peers experienced side effects from the radiation: ""Of the 21 girls in her high school class, 17 had leukemia."" ""Can't wait for the Oppenheimer buzz to die. The bomb those men built? They dropped in on New Mexico to test it. On my mother,"" Valdés tweeted. ""Tell THAT fucking story, Hollywood."" (Valdés did not respond to the Daily Dot's request for comment.) https://twitter.com/AlisaValdesRod1/status/1682055055959277570 The first atomic bomb was set off at the Trinity test site in New Mexico on July 16, 1945. The people living near the test site were not informed that an atomic bomb would be detonated near their homes. Just weeks later, in August 1945, the second and third atomic bombs exploded over Hiroshima and Nagasaki in Japan. Communities affected by the atomic bomb test site in New Mexico and other bomb sites across the U.S. call themselves downwinders because they lived and/or live downwind of nuclear and open-air explosion sites. Valdés included the hashtag #downwinders in a reply to her initial tweet. Radiation exposure can cause a host of cancers, including but not limited to leukemia—which Valdés mentioned her mother's classmates had—lymphoma, breast cancer, brain cancer, ovarian cancer, lung cancer, and stomach cancer. Oppenheimer himself died of throat cancer in 1967. The Radiation Exposure Compensation Act, which aims to compensate victims of the life-threatening side effects of radiation, was initially passed in 1990 and was extended most recently in 2022 by President Joe Biden. It turns out that more people might be downwinders had initially been calculated: A study on historical weather data from Princeton University released last Thursday found that radioactive particles were found in ""all 48 contiguous U.S. states,"" and Canada and Mexico in 1945. Valdés also tweeted that her great-grandfather saw the bomb go off at Trinity on July 16, 1945. ""He [thought] the sun rose twice that day,"" she tweeted. ""No one warned them.""

According to the event brief, the “Hazard Alert will reaffirm that workers have heat-related protections under federal law.” Juley Fulcher, worker health and safety advocate with Public Citizen, issued the following statement: “It is fitting for President Biden to push for protections from the heat in what will likely be the hottest month in recorded history. While OSHA is able to educate employers and inspect workplaces for heat hazards, it is a band-aid for a problem that won’t be solved until employers are required to protect workers. OSHA has limited options to hold employers accountable for failing to implement basic safety protocols to protect workers from extreme heat. Only a workplace heat standard will give OSHA the tools to fully protect workers. As OSHA labors to create that rule, time is of the essence; workers need protections now. “Today’s event brings much-needed attention to the dangers workers face when temperatures surge. Yet, when millions of Americans face working conditions nearly incompatible for human life, real actions to protect workers need to be first and foremost. While industry attempts to stall OSHA’s rule on Heat Injury and Illness Prevention in Outdoor and Indoor Work, workers will die.

They must be exposed for the blatant lies they areThe prospect of Donald Trump finally facing justice for the most serious of his many alleged crimes – conspiring to subvert the 2020 US presidential election – is cheering. Unfortunately, it has taken more than two and a half years to call the disgraced former president to account for his actions after his loss to Joe Biden. This delay has enabled Trump and his supporters to link last week’s criminal indictment to the 2024 election campaign. They denounce it as a politically motivated bid to torpedo the Republican frontrunner’s attempted comeback.Like so much of what Trump says, this is a blatant lie – though sadly, many Americans believe it. Biden has scrupulously distanced himself from the multiple investigations into his predecessor’s conduct.

That did not happen. Even so, special counsel Jack Smith was not appointed until last November.

Both Biden and his predecessor imposed significant restrictions on Huawei. The White House has also limited the sale of supercomputing technology to Chinese firms and sought to block China’s access to advanced chip-making equipment.

But he probably won't reply—especially if you ask about the cocaine found in the White House on July 2. That's what the New York Post and Soldier of Fortune magazine discovered after both publications reached out to Biden's Community ""phone number"" seeking comment on allegations that the cocaine belonged to someone within the family orbit and that President Joe Biden was aware of that person's identity. The Soldier of Fortune exclusive, which the Post reported on, claimed that the cocaine did not belong to Hunter Biden, but that it was someone with in the family's ""orbit."" A source told the magazine if they wanted to know who they should ""ask"" Joe Biden, as he'd been informed. Both the Soldier of Fortune and the Post included screenshots of attempting to contact Biden directly via his Community ""phone number."" Community, a messaging platform, allows high-profile figures to communicate directly with their audience through text messages. The White House unveiled the plan and number—(302) 404-0880—in early July. At the time, the White House was soliciting personal stories about how gun violence has affected their lives, according to Politico. But the odds Biden is personally monitoring those messages seems unfathomably low. So social media users are having a field day mocking the decision to text the Community number asking if the Secret Service informed him of the identity of the owner of the cocaine found in the White House. ""this is the most embarrassing image in the history of journalism,"" posted one user alongside a screenshot of the screenshot. https://twitter.com/spktr999/status/1689294710081298432 ""This person definitely called to check their extended car warranty,"" wrote another. https://twitter.com/ahodgson92/status/1689385489764331520 ""Oh my God the new York post doesn't understand how SMS programs work,"" posted another user. https://twitter.com/beckawall/status/1689365867648217088 ""multiple people grilling a chat bot to give them answers about cocaine in the white house because they think they can just text the president is the funniest 'reporting' i’ve seen in a minute,"" wrote another.

It’s a weird scenario because the former would normally preclude the latter.Let’s start with the notion that he can’t beat Joe Biden. Anyone who watched Trump defy the experts in 2016 should be skeptical of such declarations. But according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, “53% of Americans say they would definitely not support [Trump] if he is the nominee.”This leaves Trump with 47% of the electorate that is “gettable,” which is an important caveat when you consider that he picked the Electoral College lock by winning just 46% of the popular vote in 2016. However, in addition to the 53% who definitely won’t vote for Trump in 2024, “Another 11% say they would probably not support him in November 2024”—which is to say that 64% of voters are unlikely to support Trump.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,Yes,65.07307660715996,84.35246043471258,99.94213290028398,69.87637856807126,69.65051613127373,63.76249729752505,trump voters,{},"{'polls': 'recent', 'primary': 'republican', 'scenario': 'weird', 'declarations': 'such', 'poll': 'recent', 'caveat': 'important', 'vote': 'popular'}",0,1

They sat stony-faced amid much nervous foot-shuffling and laughter as the chairman, the former president of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano (one of the few African leaders who stood down when his time was up), pointed at them and said, “And we all know who Kofi was talking about, don’t we?” It was an electric moment.Annan may have been talking about African presidents, but today his words might equally apply elsewhere. Is it not extraordinary that, more than 200 years after it was founded, a political system as open and allegedly sophisticated as that in the US can only offer the American electorate a choice between two elderly males – one a serial liar and the other a decent man well past his sell-by date.

And not just Biden; what of Nancy Pelosi (83), until recently House speaker, or the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell (81), both visibly fading?

Soros! Hunter! abortion up to birth! Trans Marxists in bathrooms! - as sorry also-rans in a bleakly unpresidential race to the bottom. For Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, today's GOP evokes T.S. Eliot’s The Hollow Men: “This is the way the world ends/Not with a bang but a whimper.” Trump, of course, skipped the Fox-aired ""debate"" between clowns and thugs to witlessly blather with Tucker Carlson, who a few months ago declared of the multi-indicted former etc, ""I hate him passionately""; still, they gamely rambled through the vital issues of the day: the possible murder of Jeffrey Epstein - ""I will say he was a fixture in Palm Beach"" - by Bill Barr; ""the Left"" as ""savage animals...really sick""; the deep state plot to limit water in washing machines; Jan. 6 rioters behaving ""peacefully and patriotically."" Many chose not to watch either Trump or his fellow-cretins; explained one patriot, ""I was too busy working on my 'Mugshots of Treason' collectible trading cards."" For those unfortunates who ventured forth to bear witness to two hours of fascist-flavored gas-lighting, fear-mongering, ""substanceless statements"" and ""gelatinous ideas"" cheered on by an audience of gullible, complicit yahoos, they beheld a toxic yet vacant party that ""has become meaner, dumber, and wholly divorced from the issues Americans actually care about."" It was, argued Peter Birkenhead, like ""watching cancer cells debate health.""The event seemed even more bizarre in light of the next day's arrest of the felon who leads them all by an incomprehensible mile. Reflecting the warped, alternate reality in which their party now resides, candidates gamely pretended there was some actual reason for them to be lumbering through a contest both ""chaotic and boring,"" devoid of ideas or principles but steeped in belligerent buzzwords and ""word-salad recitation of right-wing talking points""; even so, they largely rallied the domestic terrorist troops only at ominous nods to China, Mexico, Soros, teachers' unions and other fictional seeds of their discontent. Even there in placid, mid-Western Milwaukee, the thematic darkness was clear from an incendiary opening montage of protesters, immigrants, burning cities, rampaging crime, all the evils Trump raged about in his famously deranged inaugural vow, “This American carnage stops right here and right now” - which George Bush later dubbed ""some weird shit."" Yes, but still weirdly persisting. ""Republican debates once were celebrations of American greatness,"" notes Eugene Robinson. ""Now, they are wallows in American grievance.""Thus did all eight candidates, voicing the affronted victimhood of today's right wing, labor to portray ""the wealthiest, most powerful country on Earth as some kind of hellish dystopia."" They feverishly cited civic mayhem, urban rubble, the imaginary threats of immigrant hordes, Marxist mobs, CRT and swimming trans kids and abortion ""all the way up to the moment of birth"" (which doesn't exist) while - irony alert - universally rejecting climate change, the one real danger confronting us, as ""a hoax."" ""It is not morning in America - we live in a dark moment,” declaimed businessman, loudmouth and wannabe demagogue Vivek Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old, wildly uninformed political novice who insisted, ""We're in the middle of a national identity crisis,"" maybe thanks to a presidential contender in such moronic denial of climate change he shrilly promises to ""drill, frack, burn coal, embrace nuclear"" while claiming ""more people are dying of bad climate change policies than (of) actual climate change."" More of his red-meat nuggets of wisdom: The nuclear family is ""the greatest form of governance known to mankind,"" the ""only war I will declare as President will be the war on the federal administrative state!” and, straight-faced, ""Trump is the best president of the 21st century.""Along with brazenly, incongruously stealing Obama lines - ""Who the heck is this skinny guy with a funny last name?"" he suggested the audience was thinking - Ramaswamy proved the ""weirdest guy on stage,"" surpassing even weird DeSantis, in his garish performance as a ""Trumpier than Trump"" huckster who, like ""your annoying college roommate,"" eagerly jumps into every exchange despite having no idea what he's talking about. Hence, some barbed exchanges: To his claim we shouldn't support Ukraine, Nikki Haley snapped, “You are choosing a murderer over a pro-American country. You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows."" Bizarrely, it was Ramaswamy who led the cheer-leading charge for Trump - while ostensibly running against him - after co-moderator Bret Baier announced ""a brief moment (to) talk about the elephant not in the room."" When Baier asked the motley assemblage who'd still support for ""president"" the thug facing 91 felony charges if he's convicted, Ramaswamy's hand shot up, followed by Tim Scott, Doug Burgum and Haley; excruciatingly, they were slowly joined by a sheepish Pence though Trump tried to get him hung, and shamefaced profile in courage DeSantis after he looked to see what everyone else did. The crowd cheered.DeSantis was widely deemed the evening's biggest loser, alternately angry, evasive, rictus-grimacing, stiffly canned - ""Send Joe Biden back to his basement!"" - and wooden even when issuing murderous edicts on migrants: ""We're going (to) leave them stone-cold dead."" He often appeared notably clueless: Asked, ""How would you fix the American economy?"", he responded, ""You bring Anthony Fauci (now a retired doctor) into the Oval Office (and) you say, ‘ANTHONY YOU ARE FIRED!’” Umm. He also trashed Hunter Biden's ""lousy paintings,"" criticized ""lockdowns"" that don't exist, crudely bragged about the evils he's inflicted on Florida, dodged a question on a national abortion ban but said he loved his kids' sonograms and wants ""a culture of life,"" told a freakish, bogus story - ""I know a lady in Florida"" though it was Michigan - about a woman born alive in 1955 after a botched abortion, threw in a quick anti-Semitic jab at ""George-Soros backed"" prosecutors ""victimizing innocent people,"" and oddly declined to use his fave term ""woke"" (Nikki Halley did once with ""crazy, woke things"" in schools) though he's proudly, ceaselessly proclaimed ad nauseum, ""Florida is where woke goes to die."" Huh. Now it seems Milwaukee is where it, and he, will meet their welcome, unseemly end.Sadly but predictably, the other incoherent also-rans didn't fare any better. Asked about crime, Tim Scott said the first thing he'd do is fire Merrick Garland; he also often said ""single-parent household"" and ""God’s green Earth."" Asked about the economy, Mike Pence boasted he and Trump added three zealots to the Supreme Court; he also reminded an audience of mindless, bloodthirsty, GOP nihilists he ""upheld the Constitution"" but didn't admit, per Chris Hayes, it was 'cause he ""didn't want to be another guy with a mugshot."" Nikki Haley thought there might be climate change but still China, China, China, also India. Nobody mentioned gun violence that's now the leading killer of kids in America, though this weekend saw another shooting, in DeSantis' assault-rifle-filled Florida, with ""mass fatalities."" All told, the ""debate"" laid bare a party ""unmoored from reality,"" bereft of ideas, values or policies and filling the vacuum with culture wars, racist tropes, ugly scapegoating. It struck Roy Edroso, who ""watched as much as I could,"" as ""something out of a neurological experiment,"" clearly not benign. He saw a cheap ""trunk show...loud, fast, and out of control,"" with no winners: ""Nobody...not even the screamers, expects to see a president come out of this.""Many concurred on a malignant shipwreck of a party hollowed out and stripped down to its meanest, rankest parts by a two-bit grifter - now hawking ""Never Surrender"" mugs and t-shirts marking his 4th surrender - who's left behind the ragged survivors to sink or less-than-convincingly swim. For fans of Succession, the debate's shabby specimens evoked Logan Roy's searing, mournful appraisal of his dysfunctional offspring: ""You are not serious people."" Noticeably escaping unscathed from the GOP debacle was Joe Biden, who happily embraced his no-malarkey alter-ego Dark Brandon, complete with laser-shooting eyes, in some strong messaging on Fox and around Milwaukee. Billboards featuring Biden/Brandon brashly declared, ""Social Security Cuts? Try Me"" and ""Get Real Jack. I'm Bringing Roe Back."" Biden was also on X, the dumb new name for Twitter, snarking away. To the inane claim climate change is ""a hoax,"" he retorted, “Climate change is real, by the way”; to Haley's admission that Trump added $8 billion to the national debt, he wrote, ""What she said."" And when the whole mess mercifully ended, he added a common-sense, real-world adage from his father. ""You know, my dad used to say, 'Don't compare me to the Almighty,'"" he wrote. ""'Compare me to the alternative.""",Common Dreams,Top,Yes,63.80940784244733,64.49319551487706,99.9648352520206,50.93554875680193,90.37743632812965,99.17539821541477,hollow men,{},"{'spectacle': 'surreal', 'cranks': 'tawdry', 'pygmies': 'political', 'rans': 'sorry', 'race': 'unpresidential', 'debate': 'aired', 'months': 'few', 'issues': 'vital', 'murder': 'possible', 'animals': 'savage', 'plot': 'deep', 'cards': 'collectible', 'statements': 'substanceless', 'ideas': 'gelatinous', 'yahoos': 'gullible', 'party': 'unmoored', 'day': 'next', 'mile': 'incomprehensible', 'reality': 'alternate', 'reason': 'actual', 'contest': 'chaotic', 'buzzwords': 'belligerent', 'recitation': 'salad', 'wing': 'right', 'points': 'wing', 'troops': 'terrorist', 'nods': 'ominous', 'seeds': 'fictional', 'darkness': 'thematic', 'montage': 'incendiary', 'cities': 'burning', 'vow': 'inaugural', 'carnage': 'american', 'shit': 'weird', 'debates': 'republican', 'greatness': 'american', 'grievance': 'american', 'victimhood': 'affronted', 'country': 'american', 'dystopia': 'hellish', 'mayhem': 'civic', 'rubble': 'urban', 'threats': 'imaginary', 'mobs': 'marxist', 'danger': 'real', 'moment': 'brief', 'businessman': 'declaimed', 'novice': 'political', 'crisis': 'national', 'contender': 'presidential', 'denial': 'moronic', 'coal': 'burn', 'people': 'serious', 'policies': 'bad', 'change': 'actual', 'meat': 'red', 'family': 'nuclear', 'form': 'greatest', 'war': 'only', 'state': 'administrative', 'president': 'best', 'century': '21st', 'guy': 'weirdest', 'name': 'new', 'performance': 'garish', 'roommate': 'annoying', 'exchanges': 'barbed', 'policy': 'foreign', 'charge': 'leading', 'loser': 'angry', 'edicts': 'murderous', 'economy': 'american', 'doctor': 'retired', 'paintings': 'lousy', 'ban': 'national', 'story': 'bogus', 'abortion': 'botched', 'jab': 'semitic', 'term': 'fave', 'nauseum': 'proclaimed', 'end': 'unseemly', 'thing': 'first', 'parent': 'single', 'nihilists': 'bloodthirsty', 'killer': 'leading', 'fatalities': 'mass', 'tropes': 'racist', 'experiment': 'neurological', 'show': 'loud', 'shipwreck': 'malignant', 'parts': 'rankest', 'surrender': '4th', 'survivors': 'ragged', 'specimens': 'shabby', 'appraisal': 'mournful', 'offspring': 'dysfunctional', 'eyes': 'shooting', 'messaging': 'strong', 'claim': 'inane', 'debt': 'national', 'mess': 'whole', 'sense': 'common', 'world': 'real'}",0,1
