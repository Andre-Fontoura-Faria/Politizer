0,Haley,2023-03-17,"""DeSantis Has No Choice But to Fully Commit to the Trump Bit""","Photo Illustration by Kelly Caminero/The Daily Beast/ReutersBegun, the clone war has. Ron DeSantis’ declaration to Tucker Carlson this week that the war in Ukraine is a “territorial dispute” not in America’s “vital national interests” signals that his Republican primary strategy is to run as Donald Trump’s doppelgänger (minus the gross tweets, attempted coups, and election losses).Many of us have been saying for a long time that DeSantis offers Republicans everything Trump does, only in a younger and more competent package. In that regard, DeSantis’ decision to ape Trump is not surprising at all. On the other hand, DeSantis hadn’t FULLY committed to the bit until now—which makes this development both significant and (for some of us) demoralizing.That’s because some of us Reagan conservatives were, perhaps naively, holding out hope that DeSantis might also be more…normal than Trump. That he might try to be something of a hybrid who marries Reagan Republicanism (which encompasses ideas like family values, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, and the sense that America is a “beacon of hope” in the world) with today’s more populist zeitgeist.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,No,5.941573829859614,93.64126173774446,99.7975401977258,100.0,91.41559702377424,78.80477835384215,desantis choice,{},"{'dispute': 'territorial', 'interests': 'national', 'strategy': 'primary', 'tweets': 'gross', 'coups': 'attempted', 'time': 'long', 'package': 'younger', 'hand': 'other', 'conservatism': 'fiscal', 'defense': 'national', 'zeitgeist': 'populist'}",0,0

5,Haley,2023-03-18,"""Trumpism Still Rules the GOP, With or Without Trump""","One of the common—and in my view, valid—criticisms of U.S. political journalism is that it tends to cover electoral politics as if they were horse races, with TV talking heads and print journalists ginning up the public's excitement via exaggerated emphasis on any and every point that can service a narrative of entertaining competition.We can already observe this pattern in coverage of the primary elections that will determine the Republican Party's presidential candidate for 2024. The primaries won't be held for almost a year (between February and June next year), but potential candidates are already beginning to campaign, and journalists are already busy crafting an exciting story about whether anyone can realistically defeat Donald Trump.For many of us, the prospects for 2024 are not exciting but terrifying, and the main questions are: which Republican presidential candidate, if any, would be least bad/most likely to lose? And how do we make sure that the Democrats keep the White House and gain as much power in Congress as possible? The stakes are particularly high for the transgender community, amid a national climate of increasing anti-trans hostility.The U.S. Republican Party is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, a serious threat to democracy and human rights.That hostility was on display at this year's CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference), held in National Harbor, Maryland in early March. A major political event since its inception in 1974, this annual conference brings the GOP's base together with key right-wing influencers and Republican politicians for a few days of speeches and networking.Fortunately, some journalists noted the anti-trans rhetoric at the conference, especially this explicitly eliminationist comment by prominent right-wing pundit Michael Knowles: ""Transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely.""Many have rightly called this comment genocidal, but Knowles denies this by claiming that ""genocide refers to genes, it refers to genetics, it refers to biology."" This is incorrect, according to international law, which stipulates, for example, that a group defined by religion can be a target of genocide. But, more to the point in this case, it is also simply false to claim that being transgender is an ‘ideology,' and that it is possible to distinguish a call for the eradication of this supposed ‘ideology' from a call for the eradication of trans people.Lessons from this year's CPACUnfortunately, much of the mainstream coverage of CPAC wasn't concerned with such hateful behavior. Instead, following the typical ‘horse race' pattern, the punditocracy fixated on other topics—such as whether the conference is still ‘relevant' (attendance was down compared to previous years) and whether the potential presidential candidates who aren't named Trump made the right choice either by attending the conference or staying away from it.There were scandals, too, including a sexual assault accusation against Matt Schlapp, who heads the American Conservative Union, the organization behind CPAC. And stories about presidential hopefuls such as ex-U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, who was heckled with jeers and chants of ""We love Trump.""My concern is not that these things are reported on, but how they are framed. The coverage often suggests, implicitly or explicitly, that there are real alternatives to Trump's authoritarian approach in today's Republican Party when there clearly are not. Regardless of whether Trump clinches a shot at a second presidential term (regardless even of whether he is effectively removed from the competition by being indicted for a serious crime), the mainstream of today's Republican Party will follow the same path of Christian nationalist extremism Trump came to embody in 2016.Among the confirmed Republican presidential candidates so far, Nikki Haley and ex-secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who mixes evangelical Christian apocalypticism with foreign policy (and both of whom served in the Trump administration), are not ‘moderate' alternatives. And Ron DeSantis—the clear frontrunner among Trump's opponents for the 2024 nomination, who, pointedly, did not attend this year's CPAC—is currently out-trumping Trump as the governor of Florida.In other words, as German journalist and keen observer of the U.S. Christian right Annika Brockschmidt argued, there is no significant ideological divide within the Republican Party, even if there are superficial, essentially aesthetic differences between the hardcore MAGA (‘Make America Great Again') types who continue to show up at CPAC and the Republicans who want to ""move past Trump.""'Trumpism', which we might as well call fascism, will continue to animate the Republican Party, with or without Trump at its head, and a Republican with a more sophisticated understanding of political manoeuvering than Trump may even be more dangerous as president.CPAC has always been a right-wing spectacle, but it morphed into a specifically MAGA circus over the last few years and clearly remains the same today. The same old characters—Fox News host Tucker Carlson, ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon, and Trump himself—showed up, as did a right-wing foreign leader to lend an air of international solidarity to the culture wars cause.This year, it was Brazil's ex-president and far-right favorite Jair Bolsonaro, who arrived in Florida at the very end of last year (just days before the failed, election-denying insurrection in Brasilia on January 8, an event undoubtedly inspired by the failed, election-denying insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021).But if, as numerous pundits maintain, CPAC has lost its luster as a launching pad for the GOP's rising stars, there is no reason to believe that this heralds a serious shift in the party's current Christian nationalist direction. What many have called 'Trumpism', but which we might as well plainly and truthfully call fascism, will continue to animate the Republican Party, with or without Trump at its head, and a Republican with a more sophisticated understanding of political manoeuvering than Trump may even be more dangerous as president.That Trump's potential competitors are afraid to directly criticize him now is evidence of the GOP's authoritarian character, rather than evidence of serious division. The topics on which competitors do risk mild criticisms—for example, Pompeo's reference at CPAC to ""celebrity leaders"" who ""cannot accept reality""—are much more aesthetic and superficial than substantive.The U.S. Republican Party is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, a serious threat to democracy and human rights. That's where our focus should be, and not on treating GOP politics and the 2024 election cycle like sporting events, as if their value is primarily entertainment and their outcomes will not have a serious impact on the lives of millions of Americans.",Common Dreams,Top,No,5.684824840119673,52.83322013317999,99.33380953109992,91.46617433101396,56.88147220410665,86.86853369149546,trumpism still,{},"{'criticisms': 'mild', 'journalism': 'political', 'politics': 'electoral', 'heads': 'talking', 'emphasis': 'exaggerated', 'competition': 'entertaining', 'elections': 'primary', 'candidate': 'presidential', 'year': 'last', 'candidates': 'presidential', 'story': 'exciting', 'questions': 'main', 'power': 'much', 'climate': 'national', 'hostility': 'trans', 'future': 'foreseeable', 'threat': 'serious', 'rights': 'human', 'event': 'political', 'conference': 'annual', 'influencers': 'wing', 'wing': 'right', 'politicians': 'republican', 'days': 'few', 'rhetoric': 'trans', 'comment': 'eliminationist', 'pundit': 'prominent', 'life': 'public', 'law': 'international', 'ideology': 'supposed', 'behavior': 'hateful', 'pattern': 'typical', 'topics': 'other', 'years': 'few', 'choice': 'right', 'assault': 'sexual', 'hopefuls': 'presidential', 'ambassador': 'u.n.', 'alternatives': 'moderate', 'approach': 'authoritarian', 'term': 'presidential', 'crime': 'serious', 'path': 'same', 'extremism': 'nationalist', 'apocalypticism': 'christian', 'policy': 'foreign', 'frontrunner': 'clear', 'words': 'other', 'journalist': 'german', 'observer': 'keen', 'right': 'christian', 'divide': 'ideological', 'differences': 'aesthetic', 'understanding': 'sophisticated', 'manoeuvering': 'political', 'spectacle': 'wing', 'characters': 'old', 'strategist': 'trump', 'leader': 'foreign', 'solidarity': 'international', 'end': 'very', 'insurrection': 'denying', 'pundits': 'numerous', 'pad': 'launching', 'stars': 'rising', 'shift': 'serious', 'direction': 'nationalist', 'competitors': 'potential', 'character': 'authoritarian', 'division': 'serious', 'impact': 'serious'}",0,0

It’s been more than nine years since Jordan Klepper became a correspondent on the late-night comedy show and since then has become a cultural force in his own right for his life-risking forays into MAGA world.In this bonus episode, Klepper returns to The Last Laugh podcast for a third time to preview his week as guest host of The Daily Show, starting next Monday, April 17. He shares his plans for the big chair, admits how hard it’s going to be to follow fellow correspondent Roy Wood Jr., and reveals what he would say if Comedy Central wanted to make him the show’s permanent host.As we’re speaking, The Daily Show is on its second hiatus week since a slew of mega-guest hosts started filling in following Trevor Noah’s abrupt exit late last year. When I suggest to Klepper that perhaps the schedule was planned that way to help out whatever poor soul had to follow the inimitable Wood, the comedian replies, “Wow! He didn’t do that well! Yes, he’s talented and funny, but, I mean… yes that’s exactly what it was.”Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,No,4.728074994096218,30.134716378145203,25.106630184750703,59.66571270869799,68.18625125985648,47.54846045955209,jordan klepper,{'plans': 'big'},"{'player': 'valuable', 'moment': 'big', 'night': 'late', 'force': 'cultural', 'right': 'own', 'forays': 'risking', 'time': 'third', 'chair': 'big', 'correspondent': 'fellow', 'host': 'permanent', 'hiatus': 'second', 'hosts': 'guest', 'exit': 'abrupt', 'year': 'last', 'soul': 'poor', 'wood': 'inimitable'}",0,0

71,Haley,2023-04-18,"""Loyal Friends of the NRA Vow to Save Our Guns and Fridges""","Celebrating a ""freedom-filled weekend,"" gun freaks just flocked to another NRA confab - Wall of Guns! Rifles for Two-Year-Olds! Defend Against Radical Lunatics! - to champion their sacred right to add to our bloody carnage. Among a swarm of GOP pols, the Orange Nazi memorably decried yuge gangs of ""communist maniacs"" attacking ""apartment stores"" and carting off refrigerators, air conditioners, ""fur coats, not fur coats, everything."" No wonder they wanna vote for him.The weekend's three-day NRA convention, held in Indianapolis, featured the usual delights: National Prayer Breakfast, Youth Day, much merch - I Am the NRA t-shirts, Don't Tread On Me mugs, NRA: I Am Freedom stickers - and acres of exhibits: Humvees, AR-15 Build Kits ($299), shiny new guns like Colt's bolt-action TacHunter, mini-compact handguns, aluminum M1911-style handguns with 11-round flush-fit magazine capacity, 2023's Gun of the Year Springfield Armory SA-35 9mm with NRA Grips. Because, for retailers, ""NRA members are your best customers! Can you afford to not be here?"" Distressingly, there were also many, many, sweet Jesus too many small children wistfully fingering large guns. Outside the convention, protesters took turns reading the names of the roughly 1,600 American kids killed by guns last year. Organizer Mary Tuttle noted that Indiana lawmakers just passed a bill banning gender-affirming care for minors but declined to act on gun violence, though, ""Zero children have died from puberty blockers. Not one."" Given that, in part thanks to NRA lobbying, Americans have stockpiled over 400 million guns - more weaponry than the Armed Forces, Dept. of Homeland Security, and local police agencies combined - attendees were also greeted by a billboard by Mad Dog PAC reading, ""The NRA Is A Terrorist Organization.""The convention, its stage emblazoned with ""Defend Your Freedom,"" came days after mass shootings at a Nashville school and a Louisville bank, and on the second anniversary of a mass shooting at an Indianapolis FedEx that killed nine people; last year's ever-fearless NRA held their convention days after the school massacre in Uvalde, Texas. Thoughts and prayers all around; the show must go on. Still, NRA organizers boasted the convention was ""the safest place in the USA to be today"" because - WTF - guns were banned as too dangerous. Thus did GOP Presidential hopefuls comfortably, dutifully assemble to kiss the blood-spattered ring of beleaguered NRA CEO, ghoul and thug Wayne LaPierre, who warned, “Gun-hating politicians should never go to bed unafraid of what this association, and all of our millions of members, can do to their political careers."" Some pols phoned it in: Nikki Haley, Tim Scott, Ron DeathSantis, who fresh from his pudding bragged that, even after the slaughter of 17 innocents at Parkland, he's ""resisted calls to take up gun control even when such a stand is superficially unpopular,” as though Floridians are only superficially opposed to being gunned down in America's usual killing fields - schools, malls, synagogues, grocery stores etc. He also ran an ad trashing Trump for evidently once suggesting - horrors - maybe the killing should stop.In person, a long list of mostly unknown speakers echoed him; those with higher profiles battled to go ever lower. Asa Hutchinson warned ""Joe Biden and the gun-control extremists (to) give up your pipe-dreams of gun compensation in this free society. Stop endangering our lives with gun bans and stop tramping on the rights of the American people every time tragedy happens."" Vivek Ramaswamy called for more firepower and less CRT in schools, and shutting down the FBI/ATF: ""What does the AR-15 stand for? It stands for freedom."" New Hampshire's Chris Sununu mocked Biden, bragged he vetoed a gun law - cheers - and told the feds to ""shove it."" Mike Pence got booed in his own state - ""I love you too"" - urged more armed guards, sent prayers to the latest dead kids. South Dakota's newly big-lipped, hair-extensioned Gov. Kristi Noem won cheers when she declared ""I am the NRA"" to prove it's not just old white guys - cameraman pans to audience of old white guys; ominously intoned, ""Liberals and Joe Biden want our guns because it will make it easier for them to infringe on all our other rights""; proposed after massacres, ""families gathered together (and) prayed for wisdom and discernment on how to heal hearts and minds""; and eerily boasted her 2-year-old granddaughter ""already owns a shotgun and rifle and soon will need them."" (Twitter: ""And my dog has three books and a calculator."")But Trump, “the most pro-gun, pro-Second Amendment president,” took the gun-nuttery cake, vowing, “I will be your loyal friend and fearless champion,"" like during ""the China virus"" when ""I proudly designated gun dealers as critical infrastructure."" Before the Die-Hard revenge fantasies, he made bombastic claims about his ""epic struggle"" against Dems who ""want to take away your guns while throwing open jailhouse doors and releasing bloodthirsty criminals...to abolish your borders and impoverish your families...to demonize patriots and persecute Christians while pushing the transgender cult.” Whew. It was then he went on his ""refrigerator-theft blast"" about ""these gangs of hundreds of young people (who) go and attack an apartment... department stores"" (in Dem-run cities) and ""they’re running out carrying refrigerators (and) air conditioners and big stuff. Big, little, everything. Fur coats, not fur coats, everything...They empty out the stores."" And then the police are ""standing there, they're shaking, they want to do their job, but they're not allowed to do their job because of these radical lunatics,"" even though they won't admit most violent crime is ""committed by a brutal class of hardened repeat criminals. That’s who’s doing it. In San Francisco..."" Also, tents in D.C. - ""I had to take them down immediately"" - and ""incredible monuments"" and ""beautiful lawns"" and ""the only one they want to prosecute is Donald Trump, let's get him, it's unbelievable."" Yes. It is. This evil, inept, barking mad clown - who says our mass slaughter ""is not a gun problem"" but a spiritual problem maybe abetted by ""genetically engineered cannabis"" - is the leading GOP candidate for president. Twitter had thoughts: ""Seems totally real. In fact, many people strongly say they see people running with 300-lb refrigerators strapped on their backs while wearing fur coats...They don't even put the fridges under their coats like the old days...They're taking gas stoves too just in case...With tears in their eyes?...Never mind the diamonds and tablets - grab that fridge!...They’re taking the refrigerators 'cause there isn’t strong enough water pressure when they flush the toilets on account of the birds being killed by windmills...I have seen peoople, thugs if you will, carrying 1 fish, even 2 fish, I even saw them with a red fish and a blue fish, just lawlessness everywhere...Since I'm anti-fur, I would suggest the looters stick with 'non-fur' coats. Also, Sub Zero is the fridge you want...They grab 16-ton weights, moons, Mjollnir, everything. Sometimes they just pick up the store and run with it!...And they take things that happened, that didn’t happen, we'll take that for $500...And by the way, they’re coming for you: the liberals, the Blacks, the Jews. The drag queens want to steal your children. Have you bought a gun today?"" All the while, in a broken country where many hateful, lost, white, straight men ""stand back and stand by,"" hungry for control - ""Strength. Boots, smashing faces...My rifle is my best friend - without it I am useless"" - the shooting and killing goes on and on. America's most lethal weekend so far this year, Feb. 17 through Feb. 19, saw 10 mass shootings of over 50 victims: Nine children shot at a Georgia gas station, six people killed in a Mississippi town, eleven people shot in Memphis, five people shot in New Orleans, six people shot on a Chicago expressway. This last week has been almost as bloody. Thursday night, 16-year-old Ralph Yarl was shot in the head in Kansas City for knocking on a neighbor's door while black; miraculously, he survived, and prosecutors Monday night charged an 85-year-old white man with first-degree assault and armed criminal action. This weekend, with the NRA's obscenity underway, 38 people were shot, eight fatally, in gun violence across Chicago. Also this weekend, days after the Louisville bank shooting that killed four, a mass shooting at a sweet 16 birthday party in Alabama killed four and injured 32; a shooting at a crowded Chickasaw Park in Louisville left two dead and four injured. On Saturday, Mayor Craig Greenberg responded to the bloodshed with, ""This is not who we are."" Really? Lookit these kids at the NRA fest.

114,Haley,2023-04-26,"""House Democrats Across the Caucus Call for Congress to Reject Republican Debt Ceiling Demands and Avoid Economic Default""","Today, led by Representatives Brendan F. Boyle (PA-02), Ranking Member of the House Budget Committee, Pramila Jayapal (WA-07), Chair of the Congressional Progressive Caucus, and Annie Kuster (NH-02), Chair of the New Democrat Coalition, Members from across the House Democratic Caucus called on Republicans to uphold their obligation to protect the full faith and credit of the United States by lifting the debt ceiling “without any extraneous policies attached.” The lawmakers also emphasize, “separate from the lifting of the debt ceiling, House Democrats have welcomed an open and productive debate through the normal budgetary process on approaches to address both federal spending and revenues that do not involve the threat of nonpayment of funds already appropriated by law.” The House Democrats underscore that Congressional Republicans voted to raise the debt ceiling on three separate occasions under President Trump.The catastrophic impact of breaching the debt ceiling cannot be overstated. Moody’s Analytics projects a prolonged breach would lead to a 4 percent decline in GDP, 7 million jobs lost with unemployment above 8 percent, and roughly $10 trillion in household wealth wiped out. The specter of default would haunt the U.S. economy, with GDP a full percentage point lower a decade after the crisis and 900,000 jobs never regained. Additionally, Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen warned that a default would cause a recession in the U.S. economy and ultimately could cause a global financial crisis. The letter reads in part:“Although [Republicans] recently stated that ‘the greatest threat to our future is our national debt,’ we note with puzzlement that Congressional Republicans voted to pass the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) in 2017, which the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimated would increase the federal deficit by $1.9 trillion over 10 years, with 83 percent of the law’s benefits estimated to accrue to the richest 1 percent by 2027. The first act of House Republicans in the 118th Congress under your Speakership was passing legislation — which Democrats unanimously opposed — to rescind funding for I.R.S. enforcement against tax evasion by wealthy individuals and large corporations. The CBO estimated that by reducing revenue, that legislation would increase the deficit by $114 billion over 10 years. In fact, the Republican agenda would increase the debt by over $3 trillion.”House Democrats make it clear that while they welcome debate on spending and economic responsibility, negotiations over spending must be distinct from the threat of economic default, and any cuts to Social Security and Medicare are ‘off the table.’The full text of the letter can be found here.

122,Haley,2023-04-28,"""As GOP Fears Political Backlash, Stricter Abortion Bans Falter in Nebraska, South Carolina""","Reproductive justice advocates applauded late Thursday as state legislatures in Nebraska and South Carolina voted against advancing and passing two abortion bans—unexpectedly protecting the right to abortion care in the two red states for the time being. The votes were cast as some Republicans have expressed unease over the potential political consequences of its assault on reproductive rights, even as much of the GOP remains committed to banning abortion nationwide. Republicans in the Nebraska Legislature failed to advance to the final round of debate a bill that would have banned abortion care in most cases. The party, which holds 32 seats, needed a supermajority of 33 to end debate to overcome a filibuster, but it fell one vote short as two lawmakers declined to cast a vote. The bill is unlikely to move forward for the remainder of this year's legislative session, even as Republican Gov. Jim Pillen pleaded with one of the non-voting state lawmakers, Sen. Merv Riepe (R-12), to file a motion to reconsider the bill. Riepe told the Flatwater Free Press that he had come to the decision to block passage of the six-week ban based on ""my own beliefs, my own commitments,"" but his proposal of an amendment that would have extended the ban to 12 weeks and included an exception for fetal anomalies made clear that he is still committed to forcing Nebraskans to carry unwanted pregnancies. The Republican warned his colleagues that pushing a six-week ban could harm the party's chances of winning upcoming elections, pointing to his own narrow win after the U.S. Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade last year. As The Associated Press reported Thursday, ""in a four-person race, [Riepe] emerged with about 45% of the vote in the May primary and was a whopping 27 points ahead of his nearest contender. But after the Supreme Court's decision in June striking down Roe, his margin of victory in the general election against that same challenger—a Democrat who made abortion rights central to her campaign—dropped to just under five percentage points."" Riepe is among a number of Republicans who have hesitated to go along with the party's strategy regarding forced pregnancy in the wake of the Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization decision that overturned Roe. Voters in traditionally red states including Kansas and Kentucky have resoundingly rejected Republican attempts to restrict access to abortion care in the past year, and earlier this month a right-wing judge lost a key Wisconsin Supreme Court election after his Democratic opponent campaigned on a platform focused heavily on protecting abortion rights. Dozens of U.S. House Republicans told CNN last week that they were reluctant to push for a 15-week federal abortion ban that Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) introduced in the Senate last year, saying the issue should be taken up by the states. Former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley, a Republican who is running for president in 2024, called abortion rights ""a personal issue"" at a campaign event in Iowa earlier this month and also said the states should make decisions about bans and restrictions. U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace (R-S.C.) struck a similar tone to Riepe's earlier this week when she told ABC News that her party will ""lose huge"" if it continues to pursue state abortion bans that apply to the earliest weeks of pregnancy—but has expressed approval for bans later in pregnancy. The Senate in Mace's home state on Thursday rejected a bill that would have banned most abortions in South Carolina, with exceptions for pregnancies that result from rape and incest only before 12 weeks. Three Republican women joined the other two women in the Senate, a Democrat and an independent, in rejecting the bill, a move that gave South Carolina residents a ""temporary reprieve,"" Vicki Ringer, director of public affairs for Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, told The Washington Post. The state Senate has already passed a six-week ban, which the state House may still take up before the legislative session ends next week. The reproductive justice collective Sister Song credited rights advocates in South Carolina with pressuring the Republican lawmakers to vote against the ban. \u201cCONGRATS to the incredible activists in South Carolina who halted a near total abortion ban and in Nebraska where they stopped a 6-week ban. And over in Rhode Island, a bill passed out of the State House to halt bans on health coverage for abortion. Amazing! We will care for us!\u201d — SisterSong (@SisterSong) 1682642731 Currently, abortion care is permitted in both South Carolina and Nebraska until about 22 weeks of pregnancy. Scout Richters, senior legal and policy counsel at the ACLU of Nebraska, said advocates still have ""significant work to do to safeguard abortion rights in Nebraska"" as state Republicans including Riepe continue to support strict bans and many federal lawmakers continue to back a national ban. ""Even as we celebrate today's victory, we recognize the vote should not have been this close,"" Richters said Thursday. ""From the hundreds of Nebraskans who showed up to testify on this bill to the calls and emails flooding the Capitol, it is beyond clear that most Nebraskans support legal access to abortion, and it is past time that state senators' votes reflect that reality... We will continue doing all we can to ensure that decisions about our lives, bodies and futures stay with Nebraskans and their medical providers, not politicians.""",Common Dreams,Business,No,4.067296923616008,97.80837466848024,99.87447181279212,37.70276412970363,61.53773311462881,99.60828801547152,gop fears,{},"{'justice': 'reproductive', 'states': 'red', 'consequences': 'political', 'rights': 'reproductive', 'round': 'final', 'cases': 'most', 'session': 'legislative', 'lawmakers': 'federal', 'state': 'voting', 'beliefs': 'own', 'commitments': 'own', 'anomalies': 'fetal', 'pregnancies': 'unwanted', 'elections': 'upcoming', 'win': 'narrow', 'year': 'last', 'points': 'whopping', 'contender': 'nearest', 'election': 'key', 'challenger': 'same', 'pregnancy': 'forced', 'attempts': 'republican', 'wing': 'right', 'judge': 'wing', 'opponent': 'democratic', 'week': 'next', 'ban': 'national', 'issue': 'personal', 'tone': 'similar', 'weeks': 'earliest', 'abortions': 'most', 'women': 'other', 'reprieve': 'temporary', 'affairs': 'public', 'activists': 'incredible', 'counsel': 'legal', 'work': 'significant', 'bans': 'strict', 'access': 'legal', 'providers': 'medical'}",0,1

133,Haley,2023-05-03,"""Just Normal Shooting: The Land of the Free, Racist and Homicidal""","Forgive us as we splutter with dumb rage, grief, depletion. The story from Texas is achingly familiar yet singularly ghastly: a houseful of 10 people seeking safety, a family trying to get their 6-week-old son to sleep, a drunk neighbor with an AR-15, five dead - three women, a man, a 9-year-old shot in the head. Most harrowing, two of the women were lying over children to protect them. Oh America, when will it be enough?Still, this is now our country. The victims lived in the “regular country neighborhood” of Cleveland, TX, northeast of Houston, known as Trail's End. All related, they came from Honduras to escape gang violence; one family had lived there two years; another had just joined them earlier that week. Friday night, as electrician Wilson Garcia and his wife Sonia Guzman were trying to keep their baby son asleep, their neighbor Francisco Oropeza was out shooting in his yard; Garcia asked if he could ""do us a favor and shoot a little further away because our baby was sleeping,"" but Oropeza refused. Garcia called police, there was no response, he and Guzman called four more times. In the interval, Oropeza went in his house, got an AR-15, and started walking over to Garcia and Guzman's home. ""I told my wife, ‘Get inside. This man has loaded his weapon,'” recalled a tearful Garcia. “My wife told me to go inside because ‘he won’t fire at me - I’m a woman.'"" Guzman, 25, was the first person killed as she stood at the front door. Oropeza then shot and killed their 9-year-old son Daniel in the front room, and three other victims: Diana Velazquez Alvarado, 21, Juliza Molina Rivera, 31, and Jose Jonathan Casarez, 18. Sheriff Greg Capers said the two women were lying on top of Guzman's and Garcia's infant son and three-year-old daughter, and another child: ""The ladies laying over these children were doing it in such an effort as to protect them.""The four adults died at the scene; Daniel died at the hospital. Police said they were all shot from the neck up, ""so basically in the head, almost execution style."" The surviving children were taken to the hospital; they were covered in blood but uninjured. Bizarrely, Oropeza, who has been deported four times, was known for shooting guns in his shell-casing-strewn yard, was drinking before the slaughter, and has been charged with five counts of murder remains at large four days after the bloody fact - despite the presence of over 200 law enforcement and the offer of an $80,000 reward. In truth, the response from police, even their Lone Star thugs, has been staggeringly inept. To date, they've variously listed his age at 38 and 39, changed the spelling of his name from Oropeza to Oropesa ""to better reflect his identity in law enforcement systems,"" pleaded with residents to check their home surveillance cameras, posted the wrong photo of Oropeza and then updated it - a skeptical public: ""Are you sure this time?"" They also say Oropesa has evidently ""contacted friends"" but they don't know who they are, they found his AR-15 but don't know if he has another weapon, and tracking dogs lost the scent. ""This remains a fluid investigation,"" said one official. Capers was more blunt. ""He could be anywhere now,” he said. ""We don't know where he is. We have zero leads."" Still, despicable ""political Gorgon,"" racist xenophobe and alleged Gov. Greg Abbott was quick to label the murder victims ""illegal immigrants,"" even though they were first and foremost innocent human beings who were slaughtered, their immigration status was obscenely irrelevant to the fact they were dead, and at least one was a permanent resident. Abbott, who in the last year signed seven bills to loosen already minimal gun laws - in a state decried as a hapless Wild West with the most gun deaths and NRA money in the country - didn't mention why angry drunks had access to weapons of war that, it's bitterly joked, you can buy on any damn street corner. Online, many echoed the adage, ""Shoot from the racist hip first, ask questions later."" Killing people is terrible, one noted, ""but the question is, were they illegals?"" Also, ""They were not really 'innocent' if they were illegal aliens"" and, ""If they hadn’t been here illegally, they’d still be alive."" Neighbors were more generous: ""They were a very happy family. Christian. Kind. They were always helping us."" Several said they'd heard gunshots but ""didn't think anything of it"" in a place where ""everyone has guns."" ""On Fridays, they get home and start drinking in their backyards and shooting out there,"" said one. ""We thought it was just normal shooting.""The Cleveland carnage was the country's 19th mass shooting in a year that's seen almost 14,000 people die of gun violence; about half were homicides, often during mundane, daily interactions. It also came weeks before the 1st anniversary of the horrific Uvalde school shooting that killed 19 children and two adults, now memorialized in 21 murals. Still, in New Hampshire this week Nikki Haley ""rolled out the mandatory Republican candidate gun photo"" because the ""cancer in America"" isn't guns - the “lazy, easy approach"" - but mental health; Marine veteran and Dem Rep. Ruben Gallego issued a ""poser alert"" outlining all the ways she'd get hurt if she fired. Meanwhile, the shootings go on and on: A Texas guy killed a $40 scammer, then returned to his date; an Illinois guy shot a relative during a funeral; a Detroit doctor gunned down; a drive-by shooting at a Seattle gas-station; an Illinois man shot dead by his neighbor for leaf-blowing; two road-rage shootings in Philly, which has so many homicides a local suggests, ""Just let them cut you off - don't even hit the horn""; a Texas college baseball player sitting in a 5th-inning bullpen shot in the chest by a stray bullet from the neighborhood.

Scott enters the Republican primary against indicted former president Donald Trump and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. The candidates will reportedly be joined by fellow MAGA extremist and Trump understudy Ron DeSantis, who is expected to announce his candidacy in the coming days. Stand Up America’s spokesperson, Sarah Harris, issued the following statement:“Tim Scott has tried to cultivate the image of a Republican who stays above the MAGA fray, but his voting record says otherwise. From championing tax giveaways to the richest Americans and corporations to opposing federal legislation to protect voting rights, Scott has built his career voting against the interests of everyday Americans in South Carolina and across the country. “As we look ahead to the 2024 election, it’s critical that voters understand that the current roster of GOP candidates for president––Trump, Haley, DeSantis, and Scott––are all MAGA extremists who are a threat to our democracy and our freedoms. We must do everything in our power to ensure they are not sent to the Oval Office in 2025.”Scott has long been a champion for right-wing causes. As Senator, Scott has voted in lockstep with the MAGA agenda – opposing key legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act for gun safety legislation. Scott has also been a vocal supporter of tax cuts for billionaires and federal limits on reproductive justice. Despite his “moderate” persona, he remains a strong ally of Donald Trump and continues to perpetuate MAGA misinformation and vote against the interests of the American people. Stand Up America was founded in 2016 as a digital-first grassroots community working to resist Donald Trump and his cronies’ corruption, racism, and his threats to our democracy. From 2017 to 2021, our members made 1.7 million calls to Congress to oppose the MAGA extremist agenda. In 2020, our volunteers contacted 25 million voters to help defeat Trump and elect Joe Biden to the presidency. During the 2022 midterms, our team helped build a firewall for democracy ahead of 2024 by electing pro-democracy Secretaries of State in Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota, and Nevada, passing key democracy ballot initiatives, and mobilizing our members to get out the vote for progressive candidates nationwide.

Wade last year — conservative activists have hoped that the court would repudiate many old precedents they have long disliked. On voting rights, cases such as Allen v. Milligan, which concerns Alabama’s 2022 congressional map, appeared to be potential vehicles for the court to recast the law in a sharply conservative direction. But last week, a closely divided court tempered such hopes, as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Brett M.

Good God, save us. The ""nation's premier pro-faith, pro-family event,"" the Faith & Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference was held over three fire-and-brimstone-and-bunkum days at the Washington Hilton. Coalition founder Ralph Reed opened the General Session by proudly noting that, thanks to SCOTUS hacks' junk jurisprudence, ""Roe v. Wade (is) in the ash heap of history where it belongs."" Reed also briefly addressed accusations the group has become ""a cult of personality around the former president."" Not so, he insisted: ""The truth (is) we are a cult of only one personality, (and) that is Jesus Christ of Nazareth who is our Lord and savior” - a reassuring message, indeed, to the rest of us godless heathens. Attendees wore ""Walk With Jesus"" caps, declared ""We do not co-parent with the government"" and ""Family is the greatest weapon known to mankind against tyranny,"" flocked to a book signing with Judge Jeanine, applauded godly wingnut Mike Huckabee for winning the Winston Churchill Lifetime Achievement Award, and attended an earlier anti-abortion rally at the Lincoln Memorial where Mike Pence decreed, “Save the babies, and we will save America."" We may have the principled, eloquent Schiff, Raskin, Sanders, AOC et al, but the predicants of Faith and Freedom summoned an impressive army of over 50 speakers, including almost a dozen GOP presidential candidates and the august likes of Hawley, Haley, Lake, D'Souza, Trey Gowdy, Ben Carson, Kayleigh McEnany, Tim Tebow, Oliver North, ""America's comic"" Brad Stine, the founder of Auntie Anne's Pretzels, Former Army officer Steve Russell, who wrote a book about the capture of Saddam Hussein titled ""We Got Him!"" and many other notables. ""It is so good to be in a room with happy, warrior, freedom fighters,” said Sen.Marcia Blackburn of the crowd. ""To those who believe there is no role for the unborn in Washington: You are wrong,” said Lindsey Graham. “We will restore sanity to this nation,"" said Ron DeSantis. ""This is a time to proudly put on the full armor of God."" In other words, notes Noah Berlatsky, it's time to reaffirm white Christian hegemony ""as righteous and natural,"" and Christians as a cultural group ""defined, not by belief or ethics of virtue, but by power."" ""The core truth of white Christianity is not the word of Jesus,"" he writes. ""It's that they believe, first and foremost, that they should rule."" Aptly if insanely, little wonder the event's keynote speaker was a twice-impeached, twice-divorced, multi-indicted, lying, babbling, philandering, Biblically illiterate, legally-liable- for-sexual-abuse, shameless, bonkers former ""president"" who's declaimed ""we have to bring religion back into our country"" though he doesn't even know how to hold a Bible, professed ""no president has ever fought for Christians as hard as I have"" though there's zero evidence except his vile appointment of enough SCOTUS zealots to obliterate women's right to choose, and laughably painted himself as a Christ-like victim whose enemies are God's as well. “I’m being indicted for you,” he told the devout crowd, calling each charge ""a badge of honor."" ""Together, we’re warriors in a righteous crusade to stop the arsonists, the atheists, globalists and Marxists."" In a 90-minute rant, he also vowed to ""keep foreign Christian-hating Communists (and Socialists) out of America."" Wild cheers for doing God's work. ""Our allegiance is to our country and our Creator,"" said Trump, who momentarily forgot Her name but did once try to fuck her. The stunningly bizarre alliance of the Christian right with an altogether loathsome human being, who's somehow often portrayed as crucial to God's redeeming of a sinful world, is at its core a soulless ""study in political opportunism,"" especially given an upcoming GOP presidential race where support from ""born-again pews and pulpits"" is considered a critical, if deeply dispiriting, factor. In a newly emboldened white Christian nationalist landscape - cue Lauren Boebert whining she’s ""tired of this separation of church and state junk"" - even the fringe, QAnon-themed ReAwaken America circus is moving into mainstream politics with a newly created Pastors For Trump, which plans to stump in swing states. At the Faith and Freedom synod, the surreal fact ""Trump is still king of the evangelical cattle call"" was questioned only by Chris Christie, who called out as ""a failure of leadership” a leader ""who never makes mistakes, who says that if something goes wrong, it’s everybody else’s fault, (but) when things go right, everything is to his credit...Our faith teaches us that people have to take responsibility for what they do."" He was met by thunderous boos.Reality, in short, is not the modern GOP's strong suit. Last week, fellow GOP cranks Marjie Greene and Elise Stefanik moved to expunge history itself with a resolution to disappear Trump's two impeachments for colluding with Russia and trying to overthrow democracy as a ""sham smear"" against Trump's ""good name,"" also Hunter Biden. Then the right started blaming ""wokeness"" for the Oceangate submersible disaster; they didn't even register the drowning deaths of 500 migrants enough to make up wacko stories about it, though the Onion - ""Coast Guard Sends Another Submersible Full of Billionaires After the First One"" - was on it, as were wise guys on Melon Husk's Twitter offering $250,000 sun exploration tours on a modified beeswax Cessna called The Icarus. Then Nikki Haley, who at the Faith/Freedom gig lauded an America ""strong and proud, not weak and woke,"" began wistfully reminiscing about an earlier, shining, no pain/ grief/ racism/ incest/suicide, imaginary America: ""Do you remember when you were growing up?"" she mused. ""Do you remember how simple life was, how easy it felt? It was about faith, family, and country. We can have that again, but to do that, we must vote Joe Biden out.""What the ever-loving fuck, said Americans who recalled what was going on around the time Haley was growing up in an apparent rose-colored bubble in South Carolina in the 1970s. The bitter end of a savage Vietnam War that killed millions of innocents, sparked bitter protests at home, gave rise to searing images like Nick Ut's heart-rending, history-changing photo of ""unspeakable evil"" - Kim Phúc, 9, screaming and running in terror from a napalm attack on her village of Trang Bang, her clothes burned off her. Cops and dogs viciously attacking black people - John Lewis was beaten to within an inch of his life - for seeking equal rights under the law. The grief, riots, devastation that followed the assassinations of Malcolm X, JFK, RFK, Martin Luther King. Kent State, Watergate, the '68 Democratic Convention, a country broken and bitterly divided. The president was a crook, marital rape was legal, colored drinking fountains endured, black people struggled to vote, a mob of 200 white supremacists in South Carolina attacked a school-bus filled with dozens of black children as scores of police stood and did nothing. Haley's tweet is ""a masterpiece of magical thinking"" from a woman who ""sees what she wants to see."" It exemplifies a party of magical thinking, of denial and obfuscation and revisionist history, of maudlin, self-serving glorification of a deeply unjust and often brutal past - Happy Days. Back to the (White) Future - in which white men held the power, and held tightly. When was America great, and for whom? Not for blacks, Jews, queers, women, immigrants, Muslims, Asians, brown or poor or Native or disabled or left-handed or left-thinking or in any way divergent people. The deliberate mischaracterizing of past or present - Trump's vision of American carnage, of marauding Mexican rapists, Marxist groomers and black trans vegan feminazis forcing children to read books about slavery and have gay sex - is a much-noted hallmark of fascism. A fictional (better) past was ruined by (inferior) ""others"" who must be blamed and put in their (powerless) place under a white, strict, theocratic, all-encompassing moral code. ""If you win, you need not have to explain,"" wrote Hitler. ""The victor will never be asked if he told the truth."" Nikki Haley, like the rest of her execrable party, likes to say it's time to ""tell the truth."" After her pathetic call back to ""how simple life was"" in a dreamy ""faith, family, and country"" America that only existed for a very few, many others brought some hard truth, like John Cleese on the parrot supposedly resting, stunned, or pining for the fjords: ""It has ceased to be - this is a late parrot."" ""Maybe you were not paying attention?"" suggested one. Another, ""Things seemed simpler when you were a child because you were a literal child."" Ted Lieu remembered ""when folks called me Chink. Threw eggs at our house. Slashed our tires. Called the police because they thought (we) were stealing wild ducks for food. And no one in government looked like me or you."" Jeff Sharlet recalled ""Nixon, Vietnam, every kid in my class terrified of nuclear annihilation, getting beat up for being a Jew."" Mrs. Betty Bowers said it best. ""Do you remember how simple life was, how easy it felt?"" she wrote. ""The sky was always blue. There were no winters or toothaches. Mom served us candy for dinner. Everyone got puppies.

756,Haley,2023-07-31,"""DOT Should Consider Climate Impacts of Proposed Offshore Export Terminals""","Today 130 organizations are calling on Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg to require his agencies to consider the impacts offshore oil and liquefied methane gas (LNG) export terminals will have on the climate when reviewing their applications.The letter comes as the White House Council on Environmental Quality (CEQ) finalizes best practices for federal agencies to use when evaluating greenhouse gas emissions and climate change impacts of projects proposed under the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). The Secretary of Transportation can direct the Maritime Administration to apply draft guidelines released earlier this year to six deepwater port applications off the coast of Texas and Louisiana — GulfLink, Blue Marlin, Bluewater, New Fortress Energy Louisiana FLNG, West Delta LNG, and Grand Isle LNG. “If the Department of Transportation approves another mega-polluting offshore export terminal, it will push the world closer to climate catastrophe,” said Kelsey Crane, Senior Policy Advocate at Earthworks. “This administration’s continued expansion of fossil fuels contradicts the promises Biden made to all of us when he said he would tackle the climate crisis.”Building and investing in new fossil fuel infrastructure like offshore terminals locks in decades of new sources of greenhouse gas emissions. The federal government approved Sea Port Oil Terminal (SPOT) last year, the largest oil export terminal in the U.S that will have the capacity of a quarter of all the oil the U.S. currently exports each day. Combined, the four proposed oil terminals would emit three times what the U.S. emits each year.“Coastal communities in Texas are already worried about our poor public health and hurricanes, yet this administration is pushing to increase these risks,” said Melanie Oldham, Founder and Director of Better Brazoria. “We have shown adamant opposition to more export terminals but no one is listening. Biden and his agencies must address our concerns about air pollution and the effects of greenhouse gasses before it's too late.”Last year the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) concluded that building new fossil fuel infrastructure would make it more difficult to limit warming to 1.5 degrees celsius, and would lock-in high GHG emissions for decades. If the Biden administration goes forward with these six projects, not only would it derail the country’s climate goals, but ensure that the rest of the world suffers the same fate. “Amidst the challenges posed by rising sea levels and increasingly severe storms, the approval of new offshore oil and gas export terminals compounds our climate crisis and significantly affects communities,” said James Hiatt, Director of For a Better Bayou. “It is crucial for agencies like DOT and MARAD to adhere to CEQ's GHG guidance, meaningfully evaluating greenhouse gas emissions during their reviews. These terminals would contribute massive releases of these harmful gases, and are completely incompatible with our collective best interests.”“The Department of Transportation must carefully evaluate the impact that offshore oil and LNG terminals have on the Gulf Coast and on the climate as a whole,” said Roishetta Sibley Ozane, Founder of Vessel Project of Louisiana. “We cannot overlook these consequences in the face of the climate crisis. It is time to prioritize the long-term well-being of our environment and communities over short-term gains. Our children’s future depends on it.” For additional quotes from letter signers, click here.",Common Dreams,Business,No,2.9329701894896405,97.7875176951449,99.59280785085224,0.0,52.97386026027749,82.0500592351321,dot climate,{},"{'oil': 'offshore', 'gas': 'liquefied', 'practices': 'best', 'agencies': 'federal', 'applications': 'deepwater', 'terminal': 'largest', 'expansion': 'continued', 'fuels': 'fossil', 'infrastructure': 'new', 'terminals': 'offshore', 'sources': 'new', 'government': 'federal', 'year': 'last', 'health': 'public', 'opposition': 'adamant', 'emissions': 'high', 'fate': 'same', 'levels': 'rising', 'storms': 'severe', 'releases': 'massive', 'gases': 'harmful', 'interests': 'best', 'term': 'short', 'quotes': 'additional'}",0,1
757,Haley,2023-07-31,"""EPA Petitioned to Update 47-Year-Old Toxic Pollutant List""","Conservation groups submitted a formal legal petition today urging the Environmental Protection Agency to add more than 1,000 industrial and commercial pollutants to its outdated list of toxic pollutants requiring regulation under the Clean Water Act. No pollutants have been added to the list in 47 years.The petition, from Northwest Environmental Advocates and the Center for Biological Diversity, addresses numerous categories of toxic pollutants the EPA has failed to oversee that are linked to cancer and other serious health and environmental concerns. Those include “forever chemicals” like PFAS; personal-care products that cause intersex fish; persistent bioaccumulative toxics used as flame retardants; a chemical in vehicle tires known to kill endangered coho salmon; and pesticides commonly used in industrial agriculture.“For nearly 50 years, EPA has been ignoring the growing mountain of science about the more than 1,000 unregulated toxic chemicals contaminating our rivers and drinking water, at a tremendous cost to human health and the environment,” said Nina Bell, executive director at Northwest Environmental Advocates. “The American people count on EPA to keep our drinking water clean, remedy environmental injustice, and protect fish and marine mammals from toxic pollution, but the agency has betrayed that public trust. EPA needs to grant our petition and launch itself firmly into the science of the 21st century.”The EPA acknowledges its list of toxic pollutants is outdated, a shortcoming that undermines the agency’s ability to restrict industrial and municipal discharges of pollutants into waterways. The Clean Water Act requires the EPA and states to take specific steps to prevent or limit listed pollutants from entering waters. Those actions include multiple requirements to reduce discharges of toxic pollutants.The petition cites over 300 scientific reports documenting the adverse effects of unregulated toxic pollutants and their prevalence in waterways.The original toxic pollutant list was created as the result of litigation in 1976 and subsequently incorporated into the Clean Water Act by Congress in 1977. Congress also instructed the EPA to add chemicals to the list over time.“It’s stupefying that the last time the EPA updated its toxic pollutant list, the 8-track was considered an advanced technology and Gerald Ford was president,” said Hannah Connor, environmental health deputy director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Our world has changed dramatically over the past 50 years, but the EPA’s acting like we’re frozen in the ’70s. The agency has turned its back on the deluge of new, dangerously toxic pollutants that have poisoned our waterways and permeated our lives.”BackgroundAmong notable toxic pollutants the petition urges the EPA to include in an updated toxic pollutant list are: Manganese: Manganese has severe neurological impacts on memory, intellectual development, and motor skills. Manganese pollution from coal mining and other industrial processes is particularly severe in Appalachia and has been detected at extremely high levels in drinking water, especially in low-wealth communities.PFAS “Forever” Chemicals: Despite the EPA’s efforts to prioritize addressing forever chemicals, the agency has failed to properly regulate these chemicals under the Clean Water Act in part because they have never been placed on the toxic pollutant list. These chemicals cause infertility, cancer, reduced immune response and adverse health impacts in children.Nonylphenol: Nonylphenols are widely used in a variety of industrial processes. They are endocrine disruptors and mimic estrogens, causing such severe harm to aquatic life that they have banned in the European Union. Endangered Puget Sound orcas have very high levels of nonylphenol causing harm to their ability to recover. These pollutants are virtually unregulated by the EPA.Atrazine: Despite being banned in more than 35 countries, including the European Union, atrazine remains the second-most used herbicide in the United States. It has been linked to increased risk of cancer and reproductive problems in people and can chemically castrate male frogs at extremely low concentrations, including those allowed in drinking water.",Common Dreams,Business,No,2.9329701894896405,99.94348587788608,99.93931109843804,0.0,52.97386026027749,82.0500592351321,epa petitioned,{},"{'petition': 'legal', 'pollutants': 'toxic', 'list': 'pollutant', 'categories': 'numerous', 'concerns': 'serious', 'care': 'personal', 'toxics': 'bioaccumulative', 'salmon': 'endangered', 'agriculture': 'industrial', 'mountain': 'growing', 'chemicals': 'toxic', 'cost': 'tremendous', 'health': 'human', 'director': 'executive', 'people': 'american', 'injustice': 'environmental', 'mammals': 'marine', 'pollution': 'manganese', 'trust': 'public', 'century': '21st', 'discharges': 'industrial', 'steps': 'specific', 'requirements': 'multiple', 'reports': 'scientific', 'effects': 'adverse', 'time': 'last', 'technology': 'advanced', 'deputy': 'environmental', 'years': 'past', 'impacts': 'adverse', 'development': 'intellectual', 'processes': 'industrial', 'levels': 'high', 'wealth': 'low', 'response': 'immune', 'estrogens': 'mimic', 'harm': 'causing', 'life': 'aquatic', 'herbicide': 'used', 'risk': 'increased', 'problems': 'reproductive', 'frogs': 'male', 'concentrations': 'low'}",0,1

766,Haley,2023-08-01,"""Try That In A Small Town Where Good Ol' Boys Are Raised Up Right To Lynch and Stuff""","Currently stirring the culture war pot is a new, incendiary, ""almost comically offensive"" pro-lynching anthem by country singer Jason Aldean, who posed with his redneck band at the site of an infamous Tennessee lynching to flash videos of protesters and bray that if you ""cuss out a cop"" or ""stomp on the flag,"" ""See how far you make it down the road,"" which isn't threatening at all so why is he being ""cancelled""? Maybe 'cause he's a racist ""garbage fire of a human being""? Try That In A Small Town argues that if you in any way ""act a fool"" - “Sucker punch somebody on a sidewalk/Carjack an old lady at a red light/Pull a gun on the owner of a liquor store...Cuss out a cop, spit in his face/Stomp on the flag and light it up"" - vigilante justice will find you: ""See how far ya make it down the road/Around here, we take care of our own."" In a later verse Aldean, who was on stage when a gunman opened fire in 2017 at a Las Vegas music festival, killing 60 people and wounding over 800 in this country's worst gun massacre, sings, “Got a gun that my granddad gave me/They say one day they’re gonna round up/Well, that shit might fly in the city, good luck/Try that in a small town.” As he sings, images of rowdy protests, including post-George-Floyd BLM actions, flash frantically onscreen; at one point, a Fox News chyron screams, ""State of Emergency Declared in Georgia"" - though it turns out much of the footage is from protests in Canada and Europe. Most egregious, Aldean's backdrop is the stately Maury County Courthouse in Columbia, Tennessee, where in 1927 a white lynch mob strung up and murdered 18-year-old Black man Henry Choate after dragging his body through the streets with a car. One goon reportedly taunted the teen by holding up the rope beforehand and sneering, ""Well, that sends you to hell - here you go!"" before they hanged Choate and threw his body over the balcony; the rope dangled there for several weeks. The violence is said to have haunted Maury County: At least 20 Black men and boys were lynched or ""disappeared” by the local Klan in that era, and it was the site of the 1946 Columbia Race Riot that almost saw the lynching of Thurgood Marshal. It's unclear if the producers of Aldean's flag-waving video - American, not Confederate, so good on him - chose the site because of or (improbably) unaware of its history, though some critics argue that would be even worse: ""It just reinforces that Tennessee’s racist history is truly inescapable."" Regardless, the song has enough Birth of a Nation, extrajudicial law and order dog whistles - his small town is ""Full of good ol' boys, raised up right/If you're lookin' for a fight"" - horror-struck critics have deemed it both ""an ode to sundown towns"" and ""a modern lynching song."" Predictably, Aldean denies this. While the song was released in May, the video - and outrage - wasn't released until July 14. ""When u grow up in small town, it's that unspoken rule of 'we all have each other’s backs and we look out for each other,'"" he wrote at the time. ""It feels like somewhere along the way, that sense of community and respect has gotten lost...I hope my new music video helps y’all know that u are not alone in feeling that way."" Cue wizened old guy in video musing ""what this community and a lot of farm communities stand for - somebody needs some help, they’ll get it."" Awww. That sounds so sweet. Given the song's menacing imagery and belligerent rhetoric - ""Ya think you're tough/ Well, try that in a small town...You cross that line, it won't take long/For you to find out...Try that in a small town"" - it also sounds like disingenuous bullshit, ugly light years away from ""community"" and ""respect."" Aldean's ""angry cocktail"" of country music, willful blindness, nostalgia and paranoia about anything ""other"" or ""from away"" - Nikki Haley's pining for the ""simple"" days of ""faith, family and country"" when marginalized people had no rights - is a perfect, heedless distillation of what MAGA world wants this country to be: Make America White (also straight and Christian) Again. As usual, rural (white) towns play a key role in this well-burnished mythology, serving as the defenders of America's heartland against a perilous, communist, dystopian landscape - big cities, bad crimes, foreign food, weird ideas, dirt, noise, people of color. But painting small-town America as a pristine, peaceful utopia is more bullshit. In small towns, poverty, unemployment, domestic violence, lack of health care, boarded-up businesses, mean-spirited scapegoating of ""others"" and the opioid/fentanyl epidemic are rampant; food deserts are growing, farm communities are shrinking; vigilante justice still isn't justice, and local politics are often inept, corrupt, racist, rich-centric like the rest of the country. Deaths from the ""unholy trinity (of) cars, guns and drugs"" are 20% higher in rural small towns than big cities. Gun violence is everywhere: Uvalde, Newtown, Parkland are small towns, their shooters were young local (white) men, the Las Vegas shooter was an angry white man from Iowa, 2/3 of all fatal shootings involve rural white men - who often shoot themselves - with no ""marauding bands of BLM protesters"" in sight, and to paint gun violence as a big-city, left-leaning issue is ""dog-whistling past the graveyard."" It's also, says Nashville's Sheryl Crow, ""just lame.” The country music that supposedly represents these communities likewise boasts its own hypocrisies, discrepancies and racist history. An art ""created around whiteness,"" its executives segregated country music from the start into ""race music"" and ""hillbilly music,"" thus perpetuating a white-dominated genre that ""borrowed from Black musicians but rarely centered on them,"" or even gave them credit. While it long had its progressive exceptions - Jimmy Rodgers, Mother Maybelle Carter, Johnny Cash, Dolly Parton, Willie Nelson, Loretta Lynn, Charley Pride, with many more upcoming - it was historically reactionary. Enter Aldean, dubbed by some country purists ""barely a country artist"" but more a ""mid-tempo arena retro rocker"" whose hot new song is ""a clownish, poorly-written, trite and reactionary piece of audio refuse,"" a ""dated, untimely, unnecessarily strident... grandstanding embarrassment"" without charm and a ""poorly-attempted cultural statement that has clearly proven counter-productive,"" though it's making tons of money ""being marketed well to people with terrible taste in music."" The song is now #1 on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with views of the video soaring from 350,000 to 16.6 million. Capitalism loves controversy - and evidently lots of lies. Aldean, it turns out, may be crazy about small towns, but he's not from one, nor does he live in one. He grew up in Macon, where he attended private school, and he lives in Nashville, a city of over 700,000. He also doesn't write his own songs - ""he picks them out of a catalog like a karaoke singer"" - nor did he write this one: It's written by Neil Thrasher, Kurt Allison, Tully Kennedy and Kelley Lovelace, ""none of whom are Jason Aldean,"" so ""you'd have to ask them if it's about Blacks, Jews, Antifa, homeless people, or they're just mad some teenager stole their flag."" ""What we have here is a prep school dilettante who was raised in a big city, singing a song he didn’t write, about an experience he never had,"" writes Noah Berlatsky. He adds the song nonetheless remains ""ugly and evil (because) Aldean is in fact speaking for an American tradition (that) is not limited to small towns but very much includes them, and Aldean remains ""a garbage fire of a human being."" Still, he questions condemning Aldean as a fake, thus conflating authenticity with morality: ""It's odd to criticize a racist for not being true to his racist posturing, for not being the rugged small town bigot of his songs."" At some point, he suggests ""we stop caring so much about who is 'real' and start caring more about who is good."" The consensus: Aldean's neither. After a few days of backlash, Country Music Television pulled the video. Aldean squawked the critiques were ""meritless,"" he doesn't even mention race and, ""Cancel culture is a thing...if people don’t like what you say, they (try) and ruin your life, ruin everything."" More squawking from the loathsome likes of Marcia Blackburn - ""I stand with Jason Aldean"" - Jesse Watters - ""(This is) ""open season on all of us"" - and lying Sarah Huckabee: CMT ""caved to the woke mob."" Then the video re-appeared, with BLM protests edited out. Meanwhile, Aldean kept touring, whining and sounding like a vengeful, dumb-as-a-rock thug. In Boston, he inexplicably compared his song to the Marathon bombing: Boston should understand his message ""better than anybody...Any of you guys that would’ve found those guys before the cops did, I know you would’ve beat the shit outta them...It's about people getting their shit together and acting right."" In Hartford on Sunday, protesters gathere - ""There is comfort in breaking bread together” - to don gowns and bear photos of Aldean in rainbow glory: ""Try That In A Ball Gown."" Critics had thoughts about ""societal expectations"" for the chunky singer. ""I am sure he looked beautiful in that gown without the photo-shopping"" and ""the belt buckle really ties it all together."" Talk about taking care of our own.

The founders of the country created the judiciary as the third branch of the federal government to keep executive power in check and prevent corruption. So it was a cause for deep concern last week when Donald Trump unleashed a verbal tantrum on his Truth Social platform, accusing special counsel Jack Smith of “prosecutorial misconduct” even before he filed four federal criminal counts against the former president over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in a bid to remain in office.An identical barrage came last April when a Manhattan grand jury indicted Trump on 34 felony charges for falsifying business records. That time, he also called for defunding the justice department and the FBI, even though the charges did not come from either federal agency. Both reactions were part of a long-running campaign by Trump to undermine the rule of law in the US and dismiss the multiple charges he faces, and has denied, as politically motivated. Even lawyers who once supported Trump have told me that delegitimising the law and the judiciary could destroy the country’s system of government. Yet, even if he is convicted, Trump’s supporters will probably remain loyal to him, convinced that the entire legal system is “rigged” – a favourite Trumpism.

The documents, first reported by the New York Times, urged DeSantis ""to take a sledgehammer” to Vivek Ramaswamy, the Republican entrepreneur who has slowly been gaining in the polls. Dub the primary opponent ""Fake Vivek"" or ""Vivek the Fake,"" the memo advised. Ramaswamy responded to the report Thursday afternoon, who called it ""another boring, establishment attack from Super PAC-creation 'Robot Ron' who is literally taking lame, pre-programmed attack lines against me for next week’s debate."" https://twitter.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1692202661410750526 The strategy documents indicate that DeSantis' campaign may view Ramaswamy as his biggest threat at the Aug. 23 debate, given that former President Donald Trump is not expected to participate. Ramaswamy, a political newcomer, has recently been closing the gap between him and DeSantis. A RealClearPolitics polling average between July 23-Aug. 15 shows Ramaswamy in third place with 6.7%, about eight points behind DeSantis. That's a 4.3-point increase for Ramaswamy in the last two months, compared to a 5.4-point decrease for DeSantis. And Ramaswamy is polling ahead of former Vice President Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Chris Christie—all of whom had bigger name recognition coming into the race than Ramaswamy. While the debate memo also encouraged DeSantis to defend Trump in absentia from attacks wielded by Christie, Trump has celebrated DeSantis' drop in polls, referencing a recent survey by RMG Research. The polling firm holds a B- rating from FiveThirtyEight. ""It’s over for Ron DeSanctimonious, now in 3rd place. Ramaswamy now in 2nd,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday. ""RMG Research.

This court-enforced deadline comes as a result of years of tireless advocacy from communities across the country and a corresponding lawsuit filed by Earthjustice on behalf of California Communities Against Toxics, Clean Power Lake County, Rio Grande International Study Center, Sierra Club, and Union of Concerned Scientists. Initially filed in December 2022, the lawsuit challenged EPA’s failure to take legally required action to protect the public from harmful carcinogenic air emissions from ethylene oxide sterilization facilities. “Today’s consent decree signing is a critical step to ensuring that communities across the U.S. get needed protections from ethylene oxide emissions from commercial sterilizers. For years, EPA has promised new regulations to rein in commercial sterilizers’ toxic ethylene oxide emissions,” said Earthjustice Senior Attorney Marvin Brown. “And after years of missing their own deadlines, we sued and secured a judicially enforceable deadline. Now EPA must do its part and ensure that its sterilizer rule protects communities from this cancer-causing pollution.” Ethylene oxide is a colorless, typically odorless, flammable gas used to sterilize medical equipment and in the production of chemicals needed for antifreeze, plastics, detergents, and adhesives. It is one of the most toxic air pollutants EPA regulates. This toxic chemical is a known carcinogen to humans, especially when inhaled. EPA updated ethylene oxide’s toxicity value in 2016 and admits that the chemical is 60 times more toxic than previously estimated. Despite this new assessment, it has taken EPA seven years to propose new standards while countless people and their families were left vulnerable to chronic — sometimes fatal — health impacts of ethylene oxide exposure. Now, the agency must use the best-available science to enact the strongest possible protections to ensure that impacted communities will not continue to be subjected to exposure to this aggressive carcinogen. Quotes from our Clients: “As a result of the collaboration of environmental justice communities and national environmental organizations, today marks a monumental step towards cleaner air,” said Celeste Flores, Clean Power Lake County (IL) steering committee member. “We are one step closer to ensuring that the EPA finalizes the crucial commercial sterilizer rules for EtO. We urge the EPA to act swiftly and pass the strongest regulations for healthy communities.” “EPA must adopt strong, health-protective enforceable limits on ethylene oxide for our nation’s 78 sterilizers and their warehouses that include fenceline monitoring to verify those limits are being met,” stated Jane Williams of California Communities Against Toxics. “Thank goodness that we have groups like Earthjustice to fight for us so that agencies like the EPA do much more to protect communities like ours that face extremely high cancer level risks due to dangerous ethylene oxide emissions from commercial sterilizer companies like Midwest Sterilization,” said Tricia Cortez of Rio Grande International Study Center in Laredo, TX. “We need the EPA to pass the strongest rule possible, as quickly as possible.” “Families across Texas have been forced to grapple with the pervasive health and environmental impacts of ethylene oxide emissions. EPA’s harmful inaction on regulating ethylene oxide has benefitted the profits of the sterilizer industry at the expense of the health and well-being of countless families,” said Neil Carman, Sierra Club’s Lone Star Chapter’s Clean Air Program Director. “Now the clock is ticking for the agency needs to act as swiftly as possible to finalize the strongest possible protections for the environment and public health.”",Common Dreams,Top,No,3.788388787605318,99.68660568530632,93.02693611231253,28.43241251979889,58.46061914732288,81.87430240527029,decade missed,{},"{'updates': 'needed', 'deadline': 'enforceable', 'advocacy': 'tireless', 'lawsuit': 'corresponding', 'action': 'required', 'emissions': 'dangerous', 'step': 'monumental', 'protections': 'possible', 'sterilizers': 'commercial', 'regulations': 'strongest', 'deadlines': 'own', 'pollution': 'causing', 'gas': 'flammable', 'equipment': 'medical', 'pollutants': 'toxic', 'chemical': 'toxic', 'carcinogen': 'aggressive', 'oxide': 'updated', 'assessment': 'new', 'standards': 'new', 'people': 'countless', 'impacts': 'pervasive', 'science': 'available', 'communities': 'healthy', 'justice': 'environmental', 'organizations': 'environmental', 'air': 'cleaner', 'member': 'steering', 'rules': 'commercial', 'limits': 'enforceable', 'level': 'high', 'companies': 'commercial', 'rule': 'possible', 'inaction': 'harmful', 'families': 'countless', 'health': 'public'}",1,0

The department plans to hold the sale Sept. 27. Lease Sale 261, which the Biden administration canceled in 2021, is the last of three offshore oil and gas lease sales mandated under the Inflation Reduction Act. Lease Sales 258 and 259, held in December 2022 and March 2023, were also revived by the IRA. Those lease sales were challenged in federal court for failing to comply with the National Environmental Policy Act.Today’s lawsuit challenges the upcoming lease sale for violating NEPA because Interior did not consider the health threats to Gulf Coast communities living near oil refineries and other polluting drilling infrastructure. The department also failed to adequately consider the climate harm from this massive new source of fossil fuel production. The lease sale could result in the production of more than 1 billion barrels of oil and 4 trillion cubic feet of natural gas over the next 50 years, resulting in more than 370 million tons of greenhouse gas emissions.The department agreed to limit the leasing area to reduce the risk of driving the endangered Rice’s whale to extinction. Scientists estimate there may be only 51 Rice’s whales left on Earth.The lawsuit was filed in federal court in the District of Columbia on behalf of Healthy Gulf, Bayou City Waterkeeper, Friends of the Earth, Center for Biological Diversity, Natural Resources Defense Council, and Sierra Club.In September, Interior is expected to release its final proposed five-year program for offshore oil and gas leasing. The plan, which lasts through 2028, could include as many as 11 new offshore lease sales. Holding 11 new fossil fuel auctions would sanction up to 70 years of additional fossil-fuel extraction with the potential to emit up to 3.5 billion tons of carbon pollution.Statements from Earthjustice, its clients and partners:“Once again, the Biden administration has fallen short of the federal law by neglecting to consider the impact of this massive oil sale on Gulf communities and the climate,” said Earthjustice attorney George Torgun. “We’re pleased that Interior excluded habitat for the nearly extinct Gulf of Mexico whale from this lease sale, but it’s equally critical that Interior builds on this step and protects climate and Gulf communities from the harms of leasing.”“Unfortunately, given BOEM’s history of sacrificing the Gulf of Mexico to Big Oil, this lease sale decision comes as no surprise,” said Hallie Templeton, legal director of Friends of the Earth. “Our lawsuit should also come as no surprise, since BOEM continues to rely on the same outdated, broken environmental analysis. If we are going to make a dent in the climate crisis, business as usual must stop. We are going to keep fighting until the Gulf of Mexico is off the table for good.”“As steward of the country’s public lands and waters, Interior has a duty to fully consider the harms offshore leasing can cause, from air pollution to oil spills, and beyond,” said Julia Forgie, attorney for NRDC (the Natural Resources Defense Council). “This vast lease sale — for millions of acres — poses threats to Gulf communities and endangered species while contributing to the climate crisis this region knows far too well. We are holding the agency to its obligation to carefully assess these risks and the climate fallout of this giveaway to Big Oil.”“It’s mind-boggling that in this summer of deadly fossil fuel-driven record heat, fires and flooding the Biden administration couldn’t be bothered to look carefully at the damage this lease sale will cause to people, endangered wildlife and the climate,” said Kristen Monsell, oceans legal director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “Across the country we’re seeing lethal wildfires, boiling ocean temperatures and mass coral die-offs, all caused or exacerbated by a climate unnaturally warmed by fossil fuel emissions. We’ve got to stop letting oil and gas companies make it worse by drilling in our oceans.”“It is time to transition away from fossil fuels,” said Kristen Schlemmer, legal director and waterkeeper for Bayou City Waterkeeper. “Continued development in the Gulf of Mexico creates unfair burdens on communities in Houston and across the Gulf South. Moving forward with Lease Sale 261 means more drilling in the years to come. It means more facilities in our backyards. It means higher rates of cancer and heart and lung diseases, and it means more risks during major storms.”“Selling public lands and waters to Big Polluters is incompatible with achieving the ambitious climate goals the Biden Administration itself has set,” said Devorah Ancel, Sierra Club Environmental Law Program senior attorney. “Fossil fuel extraction is destructive to communities, ecosystems, wildlife, and our climate. The devastating effects of climate change, from heat waves to storms, are particularly harmful to frontline communities, as this summer has shown. Moving forward with this lease sale locks us into extraction for decades to come, right as we should be transitioning to clean energy.”",Common Dreams,Top,No,3.788388787605318,95.6696413739984,99.68879295826942,28.43241251979889,58.46061914732288,81.87430240527029,lawsuit massive,{},"{'groups': 'environmental', 'sale': 'vast', 'sales': 'new', 'court': 'federal', 'infrastructure': 'polluting', 'source': 'new', 'feet': 'cubic', 'gas': 'natural', 'years': 'next', 'program': 'proposed', 'leasing': 'offshore', 'lease': 'offshore', 'auctions': 'new', 'extraction': 'additional', 'fuel': 'fossil', 'law': 'federal', 'director': 'legal', 'analysis': 'environmental', 'lands': 'public', 'species': 'endangered', 'heat': 'driven', 'wildlife': 'endangered', 'wildfires': 'lethal', 'fuels': 'fossil', 'development': 'continued', 'burdens': 'unfair', 'drilling': 'more', 'facilities': 'more', 'rates': 'higher', 'risks': 'more', 'storms': 'major', 'goals': 'ambitious', 'attorney': 'senior', 'effects': 'devastating'}",1,0
1220,Haley,2023-08-25,"""In a Summer of Climate Chaos, Fed Summit Ignores Risk of Climate Crisis to Global Economy""","Today, over 70 international, national and state/local organizations released an open letter to the Federal Reserve and central bankers attending this year’s Jackson Hole Economic Policy Symposium. The letter calls on symposium participants to act quickly and vigorously to address recent escalations in climate-related financial risks. In remarks this morning, Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell omitted any mention of climate-related financial risks in his Jackson Hole speech. The open letter notes that climate change impacts are outpacing authorities’ current efforts to address climate change financial risks. This is evidenced by escalating costs of physical risks and growing gaps in insurance coverage, among other things. Policy makers, especially in the banking and insurance sectors, must: Adopt a precautionary approach to risk mitigation, given climate change’s tipping points and unpredictable tail risks. This could include capital adjustments and other mechanisms to properly reflect the risk of fossil fuel production and thus facilitate a transition;Design capital buffers that specifically take into account the systemic risks of climate change;Require the use of forward-looking tools, such as transition plans, which can help both authorities and market participants better understand and mitigate their own climate-related transition risks, as well as improve understanding of aggregated, systemic risks and promote accountability. Elizabeth Jacobs, a Sustainable Finance Specialist at E3G said: “Jackson Hole is a unique setting, and not only for its natural beauty. At the 2005 Jackson Hole Symposium, warnings about risks building up in the financial system were minimized. Within the next 5 years, the Global Financial Crisis ensued, and policy makers were promptly consumed with giving themselves new authorities designed to avert future crises. Using precautionary approaches and transition plans can help avoid a ruinous rinse, wash, repeat cycle.”Alex Martin, Climate Finance Policy Director at Americans for Financial Reform Education Fund said: “Financial regulators have put in increasing effort in recent years to try to understand and better manage climate risk, but unfortunately, climate change is vastly outpacing their progress. Precious little time remains to get ahead of the risk as insurers flee vulnerable areas and banks respond in kind. Resigning ourselves to merely picking up the pieces after climate-driven financial disruptions and crises unfold—which is where we are headed—is utterly unacceptable. Regulators must double down now.""David Arkush, director of Public Citizen’s Climate Program, said: “It is shocking that this symposium, which purports to address structural shifts in the global economy, does not include a single agenda item on the climate crisis or climate solutions — some of the most important drivers of change in the global economy and most significant sources of risk to global financial stability. Rather than stand by as the next global financial crisis develops, the top officials and economists at this conference should be actively considering responses and solutions. And the officials should adopt assertive policies that shepherd the economy and financial system swiftly and safely through the tumultuous climate-related transitions that are already underway.”Jackie Fielder, co-director of Stop the Money Pipeline coalition said: “Any symposium entitled ‘Structural Shifts in the Global Economy’ without a single mention of climate disasters and the billions they have cost everyday people and local economies, should concern every American with a pension who agrees that climate change is here.”Akiksha Chatterji, lead campaigner at Positive Money US said: ""Regulators are failing to act at the scale or pace necessary to curb the significant financial stability threats arising from climate change and fossil fuel financing. Rest assured, climate risks will materialise and we simply cannot quantify the precise nature and timing of these impacts as they are complex and ever changing. Emergency measures taken after a climate-driven financial crash may not suffice to contain such a meltdown. It’s time for the regulators and officials at this symposium to adopt a precautionary approach to climate and do their jobs before another financial crisis ensues.""",Common Dreams,Top,No,3.788388787605318,50.57905986263182,90.93725958870294,28.43241251979889,58.46061914732288,81.87430240527029,climate summer,{},"{'organizations': 'international', 'letter': 'open', 'bankers': 'central', 'escalations': 'recent', 'risks': 'systemic', 'efforts': 'current', 'gaps': 'growing', 'things': 'other', 'approach': 'precautionary', 'mechanisms': 'other', 'buffers': 'transition;design', 'tools': 'looking', 'setting': 'unique', 'beauty': 'natural', 'system': 'financial', 'years': 'recent', 'authorities': 'new', 'crises': 'future', 'approaches': 'precautionary', 'rinse': 'ruinous', 'regulators': 'financial', 'effort': 'increasing', 'time': 'little', 'areas': 'vulnerable', 'disruptions': 'financial', 'shifts': 'structural', 'economy': 'global', 'item': 'single', 'drivers': 'important', 'sources': 'significant', 'stability': 'financial', 'crisis': 'financial', 'officials': 'top', 'policies': 'assertive', 'transitions': 'related', 'mention': 'single', 'people': 'everyday', 'economies': 'local', 'pace': 'necessary', 'threats': 'significant', 'nature': 'precise', 'crash': 'financial'}",1,0

Soros! Hunter! abortion up to birth! Trans Marxists in bathrooms! - as sorry also-rans in a bleakly unpresidential race to the bottom. For Kareem Abdul-Jabbar, today's GOP evokes T.S. Eliot’s The Hollow Men: “This is the way the world ends/Not with a bang but a whimper.” Trump, of course, skipped the Fox-aired ""debate"" between clowns and thugs to witlessly blather with Tucker Carlson, who a few months ago declared of the multi-indicted former etc, ""I hate him passionately""; still, they gamely rambled through the vital issues of the day: the possible murder of Jeffrey Epstein - ""I will say he was a fixture in Palm Beach"" - by Bill Barr; ""the Left"" as ""savage animals...really sick""; the deep state plot to limit water in washing machines; Jan. 6 rioters behaving ""peacefully and patriotically."" Many chose not to watch either Trump or his fellow-cretins; explained one patriot, ""I was too busy working on my 'Mugshots of Treason' collectible trading cards."" For those unfortunates who ventured forth to bear witness to two hours of fascist-flavored gas-lighting, fear-mongering, ""substanceless statements"" and ""gelatinous ideas"" cheered on by an audience of gullible, complicit yahoos, they beheld a toxic yet vacant party that ""has become meaner, dumber, and wholly divorced from the issues Americans actually care about."" It was, argued Peter Birkenhead, like ""watching cancer cells debate health.""The event seemed even more bizarre in light of the next day's arrest of the felon who leads them all by an incomprehensible mile. Reflecting the warped, alternate reality in which their party now resides, candidates gamely pretended there was some actual reason for them to be lumbering through a contest both ""chaotic and boring,"" devoid of ideas or principles but steeped in belligerent buzzwords and ""word-salad recitation of right-wing talking points""; even so, they largely rallied the domestic terrorist troops only at ominous nods to China, Mexico, Soros, teachers' unions and other fictional seeds of their discontent. Even there in placid, mid-Western Milwaukee, the thematic darkness was clear from an incendiary opening montage of protesters, immigrants, burning cities, rampaging crime, all the evils Trump raged about in his famously deranged inaugural vow, “This American carnage stops right here and right now” - which George Bush later dubbed ""some weird shit."" Yes, but still weirdly persisting. ""Republican debates once were celebrations of American greatness,"" notes Eugene Robinson. ""Now, they are wallows in American grievance.""Thus did all eight candidates, voicing the affronted victimhood of today's right wing, labor to portray ""the wealthiest, most powerful country on Earth as some kind of hellish dystopia."" They feverishly cited civic mayhem, urban rubble, the imaginary threats of immigrant hordes, Marxist mobs, CRT and swimming trans kids and abortion ""all the way up to the moment of birth"" (which doesn't exist) while - irony alert - universally rejecting climate change, the one real danger confronting us, as ""a hoax."" ""It is not morning in America - we live in a dark moment,” declaimed businessman, loudmouth and wannabe demagogue Vivek Ramaswamy, a 38-year-old, wildly uninformed political novice who insisted, ""We're in the middle of a national identity crisis,"" maybe thanks to a presidential contender in such moronic denial of climate change he shrilly promises to ""drill, frack, burn coal, embrace nuclear"" while claiming ""more people are dying of bad climate change policies than (of) actual climate change."" More of his red-meat nuggets of wisdom: The nuclear family is ""the greatest form of governance known to mankind,"" the ""only war I will declare as President will be the war on the federal administrative state!” and, straight-faced, ""Trump is the best president of the 21st century.""Along with brazenly, incongruously stealing Obama lines - ""Who the heck is this skinny guy with a funny last name?"" he suggested the audience was thinking - Ramaswamy proved the ""weirdest guy on stage,"" surpassing even weird DeSantis, in his garish performance as a ""Trumpier than Trump"" huckster who, like ""your annoying college roommate,"" eagerly jumps into every exchange despite having no idea what he's talking about. Hence, some barbed exchanges: To his claim we shouldn't support Ukraine, Nikki Haley snapped, “You are choosing a murderer over a pro-American country. You have no foreign policy experience, and it shows."" Bizarrely, it was Ramaswamy who led the cheer-leading charge for Trump - while ostensibly running against him - after co-moderator Bret Baier announced ""a brief moment (to) talk about the elephant not in the room."" When Baier asked the motley assemblage who'd still support for ""president"" the thug facing 91 felony charges if he's convicted, Ramaswamy's hand shot up, followed by Tim Scott, Doug Burgum and Haley; excruciatingly, they were slowly joined by a sheepish Pence though Trump tried to get him hung, and shamefaced profile in courage DeSantis after he looked to see what everyone else did. The crowd cheered.DeSantis was widely deemed the evening's biggest loser, alternately angry, evasive, rictus-grimacing, stiffly canned - ""Send Joe Biden back to his basement!"" - and wooden even when issuing murderous edicts on migrants: ""We're going (to) leave them stone-cold dead."" He often appeared notably clueless: Asked, ""How would you fix the American economy?"", he responded, ""You bring Anthony Fauci (now a retired doctor) into the Oval Office (and) you say, ‘ANTHONY YOU ARE FIRED!’” Umm. He also trashed Hunter Biden's ""lousy paintings,"" criticized ""lockdowns"" that don't exist, crudely bragged about the evils he's inflicted on Florida, dodged a question on a national abortion ban but said he loved his kids' sonograms and wants ""a culture of life,"" told a freakish, bogus story - ""I know a lady in Florida"" though it was Michigan - about a woman born alive in 1955 after a botched abortion, threw in a quick anti-Semitic jab at ""George-Soros backed"" prosecutors ""victimizing innocent people,"" and oddly declined to use his fave term ""woke"" (Nikki Halley did once with ""crazy, woke things"" in schools) though he's proudly, ceaselessly proclaimed ad nauseum, ""Florida is where woke goes to die."" Huh. Now it seems Milwaukee is where it, and he, will meet their welcome, unseemly end.Sadly but predictably, the other incoherent also-rans didn't fare any better. Asked about crime, Tim Scott said the first thing he'd do is fire Merrick Garland; he also often said ""single-parent household"" and ""God’s green Earth."" Asked about the economy, Mike Pence boasted he and Trump added three zealots to the Supreme Court; he also reminded an audience of mindless, bloodthirsty, GOP nihilists he ""upheld the Constitution"" but didn't admit, per Chris Hayes, it was 'cause he ""didn't want to be another guy with a mugshot."" Nikki Haley thought there might be climate change but still China, China, China, also India. Nobody mentioned gun violence that's now the leading killer of kids in America, though this weekend saw another shooting, in DeSantis' assault-rifle-filled Florida, with ""mass fatalities."" All told, the ""debate"" laid bare a party ""unmoored from reality,"" bereft of ideas, values or policies and filling the vacuum with culture wars, racist tropes, ugly scapegoating. It struck Roy Edroso, who ""watched as much as I could,"" as ""something out of a neurological experiment,"" clearly not benign. He saw a cheap ""trunk show...loud, fast, and out of control,"" with no winners: ""Nobody...not even the screamers, expects to see a president come out of this.""Many concurred on a malignant shipwreck of a party hollowed out and stripped down to its meanest, rankest parts by a two-bit grifter - now hawking ""Never Surrender"" mugs and t-shirts marking his 4th surrender - who's left behind the ragged survivors to sink or less-than-convincingly swim. For fans of Succession, the debate's shabby specimens evoked Logan Roy's searing, mournful appraisal of his dysfunctional offspring: ""You are not serious people."" Noticeably escaping unscathed from the GOP debacle was Joe Biden, who happily embraced his no-malarkey alter-ego Dark Brandon, complete with laser-shooting eyes, in some strong messaging on Fox and around Milwaukee. Billboards featuring Biden/Brandon brashly declared, ""Social Security Cuts? Try Me"" and ""Get Real Jack. I'm Bringing Roe Back."" Biden was also on X, the dumb new name for Twitter, snarking away. To the inane claim climate change is ""a hoax,"" he retorted, “Climate change is real, by the way”; to Haley's admission that Trump added $8 billion to the national debt, he wrote, ""What she said."" And when the whole mess mercifully ended, he added a common-sense, real-world adage from his father. ""You know, my dad used to say, 'Don't compare me to the Almighty,'"" he wrote. ""'Compare me to the alternative.""",Common Dreams,Top,No,5.295824450945888,64.40918815040864,99.96460810805638,78.536575232146,45.944844531234544,81.83211010525099,hollow men,{},"{'spectacle': 'surreal', 'cranks': 'tawdry', 'pygmies': 'political', 'rans': 'sorry', 'race': 'unpresidential', 'debate': 'aired', 'months': 'few', 'issues': 'vital', 'murder': 'possible', 'animals': 'savage', 'plot': 'deep', 'cards': 'collectible', 'statements': 'substanceless', 'ideas': 'gelatinous', 'yahoos': 'gullible', 'party': 'unmoored', 'day': 'next', 'mile': 'incomprehensible', 'reality': 'alternate', 'reason': 'actual', 'contest': 'chaotic', 'buzzwords': 'belligerent', 'recitation': 'salad', 'wing': 'right', 'points': 'wing', 'troops': 'terrorist', 'nods': 'ominous', 'seeds': 'fictional', 'darkness': 'thematic', 'montage': 'incendiary', 'cities': 'burning', 'vow': 'inaugural', 'carnage': 'american', 'shit': 'weird', 'debates': 'republican', 'greatness': 'american', 'grievance': 'american', 'victimhood': 'affronted', 'country': 'american', 'dystopia': 'hellish', 'mayhem': 'civic', 'rubble': 'urban', 'threats': 'imaginary', 'mobs': 'marxist', 'danger': 'real', 'moment': 'brief', 'businessman': 'declaimed', 'novice': 'political', 'crisis': 'national', 'contender': 'presidential', 'denial': 'moronic', 'coal': 'burn', 'people': 'serious', 'policies': 'bad', 'change': 'actual', 'meat': 'red', 'family': 'nuclear', 'form': 'greatest', 'war': 'only', 'state': 'administrative', 'president': 'best', 'century': '21st', 'guy': 'weirdest', 'name': 'new', 'performance': 'garish', 'roommate': 'annoying', 'exchanges': 'barbed', 'policy': 'foreign', 'charge': 'leading', 'loser': 'angry', 'edicts': 'murderous', 'economy': 'american', 'doctor': 'retired', 'paintings': 'lousy', 'ban': 'national', 'story': 'bogus', 'abortion': 'botched', 'jab': 'semitic', 'term': 'fave', 'nauseum': 'proclaimed', 'end': 'unseemly', 'thing': 'first', 'parent': 'single', 'nihilists': 'bloodthirsty', 'killer': 'leading', 'fatalities': 'mass', 'tropes': 'racist', 'experiment': 'neurological', 'show': 'loud', 'shipwreck': 'malignant', 'parts': 'rankest', 'surrender': '4th', 'survivors': 'ragged', 'specimens': 'shabby', 'appraisal': 'mournful', 'offspring': 'dysfunctional', 'eyes': 'shooting', 'messaging': 'strong', 'claim': 'inane', 'debt': 'national', 'mess': 'whole', 'sense': 'common', 'world': 'real'}",1,0
