16,DeSantis,2023-03-16,"""Florida's ""Stop W.O.K.E."" Censorship Bill Continues to Be Blocked After Eleventh Circuit Decision""","In an important victory for professors, other educators, and students across Florida, the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals left in place a preliminary injunction blocking Florida’s HB 7 — also known as the Stop Wrongs Against Our Kids and Employees Act (Stop W.O.K.E. Act) — from being enforced in institutions of higher education, pending appeal. The procedural ruling maintains the preliminary injunction until the Eleventh Circuit issues a decision on the merits. The previous order was issued in Pernell v. Lamb, a lawsuit filed by a multi-racial group of educators and a student in Florida colleges and universities challenging the discriminatory classroom censorship law that severely restricts Florida educators and students from engaging in scholarship about issues related to race and gender. The preliminary injunction immediately blocked the state from enforcing the law in institutions of higher education in Florida. And in separate litigation, Judge Mark Walker blocked the law from affecting Florida employers.The plaintiffs are represented by the American Civil Liberties Union, the ACLU of Florida, the Legal Defense Fund (LDF), and pro bono counsel Ballard Spahr. Florida is one of more than a dozen states across the country that have passed at least 15 different laws aimed at censoring discussions around race and gender in the classroom.“The court’s decision to leave in place the preliminary injunction is a recognition of the serious injury posed to educators and students by the Stop W.O.K.E. Act,” said Leah Watson, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Racial Justice Program. “All students and educators deserve to have a free and open exchange about issues related to race in our classrooms — not censored discussions that erases the history of discrimination and lived experiences of Black and Brown people, women and girls, and LGBTQ+ individuals.”The lawsuit argues the Stop W.O.K.E. Act violates the First and 14th Amendments by imposing viewpoint-based restrictions on educators (including professors, lecturers, and student teaching assistants) and students that are vague and discriminatory. Additionally, it argues the Stop W.O.K.E. Act violates the Equal Protection Clause because it was enacted with the intent to discriminate against Black educators and students.“We are heartened by the court’s decision to leave in place the preliminary injunction issued by the federal court in November,” said Alexsis Johnson, assistant counsel of the Legal Defense Fund. “Institutions of higher education in Florida should have the ability to provide a quality education, which simply cannot happen when students and educators, including Black students and educators, feel they cannot speak freely about their lived experiences, or when they feel that they may incur a politician’s wrath for engaging in a fact-based discussion of our history.”The bill specifically targets and places vague restrictions on educators’ ability to teach and discuss concepts around the legacy of slavery in America, white privilege, and anti-racism. In January, Gov. Ron DeSantis announced plans to prohibit “higher education institutions from using any funding, regardless of source, to support DEI, CRT,” and what he inaccurately calls “other discriminatory initiatives.” It’s yet another attempt to stop educators from teaching or even expressing viewpoints on race, racism, or gender that are disfavored by Florida lawmakers, even where those viewpoints are widely accepted and considered foundational information in their academic disciplines.“We are pleased that the court protected the First Amendment rights of Florida students and educators by denying the State’s request for a stay,” said Jerry Edwards, staff attorney with the ACLU of Florida. “Lawmakers continue to threaten our democracy by attempting to curtail important discussions about our collective history and treatment of Black and Brown communities. This is an important step in preserving the truth, civil liberties, and a better future.”The Stop W.O.K.E. Act imposes harsh penalties — including possible termination or loss of state funding — for educators who have been found to violate the law. As a result, universities across Florida have canceled or scaled back diversity and inclusion trainings and have taken down public-facing statements denouncing racism. This creates a hostile climate that stigmatizes discussions about race on campuses and generates fear among plaintiffs and other Black educators and students who teach or take coursework that touch upon race and gender issues.“The movement to restrict academic freedom and curtail the rights of marginalized communities is as pervasive as it is pernicious,” said Jason Leckerman, litigation department chair at Ballard Spahr. “We are proud of the work we have done so far with our partners, the ACLU and Legal Defense Fund, but the fight is far from over. Today, we’ll take a moment to savor this result — and then we’ll keep working.”The court’s refusal to lift the injunction during appeal could bolster similar challenges to classroom censorship efforts in Florida, and other states. Currently the ACLU has challenged similar classroom censorship laws in Oklahoma, which was the first federal lawsuit challenging one of these bills, and in New Hampshire, and awaits rulings in both cases.",Common Dreams,Business,Yes,34.00610636206288,96.69122515854431,40.17201335098772,90.82594983322284,13.373935602894639,61.204208669914664,florida stop,{},"{'victory': 'important', 'educators': 'black', 'injunction': 'preliminary', 'education': 'higher', 'appeal': 'pending', 'ruling': 'procedural', 'order': 'previous', 'group': 'racial', 'law': 'discriminatory', 'litigation': 'separate', 'dozen': 'more', 'laws': 'similar', 'discussions': 'important', 'injury': 'serious', 'attorney': 'senior', 'exchange': 'free', 'experiences': 'lived', 'people': 'black', 'individuals': 'lgbtq+', 'amendments': 'first', 'restrictions': 'vague', 'court': 'federal', 'counsel': 'assistant', 'students': 'black', 'discussion': 'based', 'privilege': 'white', 'institutions': 'higher', 'initiatives': 'discriminatory', 'information': 'foundational', 'disciplines': 'academic', 'history': 'collective', 'communities': 'marginalized', 'step': 'important', 'liberties': 'civil', 'future': 'better', 'penalties': 'harsh', 'termination': 'possible', 'statements': 'facing', 'climate': 'hostile', 'freedom': 'academic', 'challenges': 'similar', 'states': 'other', 'lawsuit': 'federal'}",0,0

Ron DeSantis’ declaration to Tucker Carlson this week that the war in Ukraine is a “territorial dispute” not in America’s “vital national interests” signals that his Republican primary strategy is to run as Donald Trump’s doppelgänger (minus the gross tweets, attempted coups, and election losses).Many of us have been saying for a long time that DeSantis offers Republicans everything Trump does, only in a younger and more competent package. In that regard, DeSantis’ decision to ape Trump is not surprising at all. On the other hand, DeSantis hadn’t FULLY committed to the bit until now—which makes this development both significant and (for some of us) demoralizing.That’s because some of us Reagan conservatives were, perhaps naively, holding out hope that DeSantis might also be more…normal than Trump. That he might try to be something of a hybrid who marries Reagan Republicanism (which encompasses ideas like family values, fiscal conservatism, a strong national defense, and the sense that America is a “beacon of hope” in the world) with today’s more populist zeitgeist.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,No,36.05056725633505,93.66884332357267,99.79776254314709,100.0,73.92624480792716,63.55457839870927,desantis choice,{},"{'dispute': 'territorial', 'interests': 'national', 'strategy': 'primary', 'tweets': 'gross', 'coups': 'attempted', 'time': 'long', 'package': 'younger', 'hand': 'other', 'conservatism': 'fiscal', 'defense': 'national', 'zeitgeist': 'populist'}",1,1

The appellate court denied a request from Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration and higher education officials to block a district judge's injunction that is currently preventing enforcement of the Stop Wrongs Against Our Kids and Employees (WOKE) Act—rebranded by its supporters as the Individual Freedom Act—in the state's public colleges and universities. DeSantis' Stop WOKE Act ""limits the ways concepts related to systemic racism and sex discrimination can be discussed in teaching or conducting training in workplaces or schools,"" parroting a Trump administration executive order that was ultimately rescinded by President Joe Biden, the ACLU explained last year. The plaintiffs in one of the relevant cases, Pernell v. Florida Board of Governors, are represented by the national and state ACLU along with the Legal Defense Fund (LDF) and Ballard Spahr, who first filed the federal suit last August—the same day U.S. District Judge Mark Walker, an appointee of former President Barack Obama, issued a separate injunction against the law related to employers. The new appeals court order upholds the injunction Walker issued in November, which began by quoting George Orwell's novel 1984. Calling the controversial law ""positively dystopian,"" the judge wrote at the time that ""the powers in charge of Florida's public university system have declared the state has unfettered authority to muzzle its professors in the name of 'freedom.'"" ""All students and educators deserve to have a free and open exchange about issues related to race in our classrooms."" Leah Watson, a senior staff attorney with the ACLU Racial Justice Program, said Thursday that ""the court's decision to leave in place the preliminary injunction is a recognition of the serious injury posed to educators and students by the Stop WOKE Act."" ""All students and educators deserve to have a free and open exchange about issues related to race in our classrooms,"" Watson argued, rather than censored discussions that erase ""the history of discrimination and lived experiences of Black and Brown people, women and girls, and LGBTQ+ individuals."" LDF assistant counsel Alexsis Johnson similarly stressed that ""institutions of higher education in Florida should have the ability to provide a quality education, which simply cannot happen when students and educators, including Black students and educators, feel they cannot speak freely about their lived experiences, or when they feel that they may incur a politician's wrath for engaging in a fact-based discussion of our history."" The order also pertains to a challenge filed by the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) in September.""Professors must be able to discuss subjects like race and gender without hesitation or fear of state reprisal,"" FIRE said Thursday. ""Any law that limits the free exchange of ideas in university classrooms should lose in both the court of law and the court of public opinion."" The Stop WOKE Act is part of a nationwide effort by Republican state lawmakers and governors—especially DeSantis, a potential 2024 GOP presidential candidate—to curtail what content can be shared and discussed in classrooms and workplaces. ""Since January 2021, 44 states have introduced bills or taken other steps that would restrict teaching critical race theory or limit how teachers can discuss racism and sexism,"" according to an Education Week analysis updated on Monday. ""Eighteen states have imposed these bans and restrictions either through legislation or other avenues."" None — (@) ACLU of Florida staff attorney Jerry Edwards warned Thursday that ""lawmakers continue to threaten our democracy by attempting to curtail important discussions about our collective history and treatment of Black and Brown communities."" ""This is an important step in preserving the truth, civil liberties, and a better future,"" Edwards said of the 11th Circuit's decision. Though legal groups welcomed the order, the battle over the law is ongoing. The court will eventually rule on the merits of the case—which DeSantis' press secretary Bryan Griffin highlighted Thursday, adding, ""We remain confident that the law is constitutional.""Opponents of the law are also undeterred, as Ballard Spahr litigation department chair Jason Leckerman made clear.

32,DeSantis,2023-03-18,"""Trumpism Still Rules the GOP, With or Without Trump""","One of the common—and in my view, valid—criticisms of U.S. political journalism is that it tends to cover electoral politics as if they were horse races, with TV talking heads and print journalists ginning up the public's excitement via exaggerated emphasis on any and every point that can service a narrative of entertaining competition.We can already observe this pattern in coverage of the primary elections that will determine the Republican Party's presidential candidate for 2024. The primaries won't be held for almost a year (between February and June next year), but potential candidates are already beginning to campaign, and journalists are already busy crafting an exciting story about whether anyone can realistically defeat Donald Trump.For many of us, the prospects for 2024 are not exciting but terrifying, and the main questions are: which Republican presidential candidate, if any, would be least bad/most likely to lose? And how do we make sure that the Democrats keep the White House and gain as much power in Congress as possible? The stakes are particularly high for the transgender community, amid a national climate of increasing anti-trans hostility.The U.S. Republican Party is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, a serious threat to democracy and human rights.That hostility was on display at this year's CPAC (Conservative Political Action Conference), held in National Harbor, Maryland in early March. A major political event since its inception in 1974, this annual conference brings the GOP's base together with key right-wing influencers and Republican politicians for a few days of speeches and networking.Fortunately, some journalists noted the anti-trans rhetoric at the conference, especially this explicitly eliminationist comment by prominent right-wing pundit Michael Knowles: ""Transgenderism must be eradicated from public life entirely.""Many have rightly called this comment genocidal, but Knowles denies this by claiming that ""genocide refers to genes, it refers to genetics, it refers to biology."" This is incorrect, according to international law, which stipulates, for example, that a group defined by religion can be a target of genocide. But, more to the point in this case, it is also simply false to claim that being transgender is an ‘ideology,' and that it is possible to distinguish a call for the eradication of this supposed ‘ideology' from a call for the eradication of trans people.Lessons from this year's CPACUnfortunately, much of the mainstream coverage of CPAC wasn't concerned with such hateful behavior. Instead, following the typical ‘horse race' pattern, the punditocracy fixated on other topics—such as whether the conference is still ‘relevant' (attendance was down compared to previous years) and whether the potential presidential candidates who aren't named Trump made the right choice either by attending the conference or staying away from it.There were scandals, too, including a sexual assault accusation against Matt Schlapp, who heads the American Conservative Union, the organization behind CPAC. And stories about presidential hopefuls such as ex-U.N. ambassador Nikki Haley, who was heckled with jeers and chants of ""We love Trump.""My concern is not that these things are reported on, but how they are framed. The coverage often suggests, implicitly or explicitly, that there are real alternatives to Trump's authoritarian approach in today's Republican Party when there clearly are not. Regardless of whether Trump clinches a shot at a second presidential term (regardless even of whether he is effectively removed from the competition by being indicted for a serious crime), the mainstream of today's Republican Party will follow the same path of Christian nationalist extremism Trump came to embody in 2016.Among the confirmed Republican presidential candidates so far, Nikki Haley and ex-secretary of state Mike Pompeo, who mixes evangelical Christian apocalypticism with foreign policy (and both of whom served in the Trump administration), are not ‘moderate' alternatives. And Ron DeSantis—the clear frontrunner among Trump's opponents for the 2024 nomination, who, pointedly, did not attend this year's CPAC—is currently out-trumping Trump as the governor of Florida.In other words, as German journalist and keen observer of the U.S. Christian right Annika Brockschmidt argued, there is no significant ideological divide within the Republican Party, even if there are superficial, essentially aesthetic differences between the hardcore MAGA (‘Make America Great Again') types who continue to show up at CPAC and the Republicans who want to ""move past Trump.""'Trumpism', which we might as well call fascism, will continue to animate the Republican Party, with or without Trump at its head, and a Republican with a more sophisticated understanding of political manoeuvering than Trump may even be more dangerous as president.CPAC has always been a right-wing spectacle, but it morphed into a specifically MAGA circus over the last few years and clearly remains the same today. The same old characters—Fox News host Tucker Carlson, ex-Trump strategist Steve Bannon, and Trump himself—showed up, as did a right-wing foreign leader to lend an air of international solidarity to the culture wars cause.This year, it was Brazil's ex-president and far-right favorite Jair Bolsonaro, who arrived in Florida at the very end of last year (just days before the failed, election-denying insurrection in Brasilia on January 8, an event undoubtedly inspired by the failed, election-denying insurrection at the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021).But if, as numerous pundits maintain, CPAC has lost its luster as a launching pad for the GOP's rising stars, there is no reason to believe that this heralds a serious shift in the party's current Christian nationalist direction. What many have called 'Trumpism', but which we might as well plainly and truthfully call fascism, will continue to animate the Republican Party, with or without Trump at its head, and a Republican with a more sophisticated understanding of political manoeuvering than Trump may even be more dangerous as president.That Trump's potential competitors are afraid to directly criticize him now is evidence of the GOP's authoritarian character, rather than evidence of serious division. The topics on which competitors do risk mild criticisms—for example, Pompeo's reference at CPAC to ""celebrity leaders"" who ""cannot accept reality""—are much more aesthetic and superficial than substantive.The U.S. Republican Party is, and will remain for the foreseeable future, a serious threat to democracy and human rights. That's where our focus should be, and not on treating GOP politics and the 2024 election cycle like sporting events, as if their value is primarily entertainment and their outcomes will not have a serious impact on the lives of millions of Americans.",Common Dreams,Top,No,35.94354885493204,53.0382700013864,99.33536067727186,99.51977942645412,71.10841870914113,62.69906613413907,trumpism still,{},"{'criticisms': 'mild', 'journalism': 'political', 'politics': 'electoral', 'heads': 'talking', 'emphasis': 'exaggerated', 'competition': 'entertaining', 'elections': 'primary', 'candidate': 'presidential', 'year': 'last', 'candidates': 'presidential', 'story': 'exciting', 'questions': 'main', 'power': 'much', 'climate': 'national', 'hostility': 'trans', 'future': 'foreseeable', 'threat': 'serious', 'rights': 'human', 'event': 'political', 'conference': 'annual', 'influencers': 'wing', 'wing': 'right', 'politicians': 'republican', 'days': 'few', 'rhetoric': 'trans', 'comment': 'eliminationist', 'pundit': 'prominent', 'life': 'public', 'law': 'international', 'ideology': 'supposed', 'behavior': 'hateful', 'pattern': 'typical', 'topics': 'other', 'years': 'few', 'choice': 'right', 'assault': 'sexual', 'hopefuls': 'presidential', 'ambassador': 'u.n.', 'alternatives': 'moderate', 'approach': 'authoritarian', 'term': 'presidential', 'crime': 'serious', 'path': 'same', 'extremism': 'nationalist', 'apocalypticism': 'christian', 'policy': 'foreign', 'frontrunner': 'clear', 'words': 'other', 'journalist': 'german', 'observer': 'keen', 'right': 'christian', 'divide': 'ideological', 'differences': 'aesthetic', 'understanding': 'sophisticated', 'manoeuvering': 'political', 'spectacle': 'wing', 'characters': 'old', 'strategist': 'trump', 'leader': 'foreign', 'solidarity': 'international', 'end': 'very', 'insurrection': 'denying', 'pundits': 'numerous', 'pad': 'launching', 'stars': 'rising', 'shift': 'serious', 'direction': 'nationalist', 'competitors': 'potential', 'character': 'authoritarian', 'division': 'serious', 'impact': 'serious'}",0,0

39,DeSantis,2023-03-18,"""'Threat to the Nation': Trump Calls for Protests to Stop Potential Arrest in Echo of Jan. 6""","Former U.S. President Donald Trump claimed Saturday on his social media platform that he ""will be arrested"" on Tuesday and implored his supporters to ""protest"" and ""take our nation back,"" sparking fears of additional right-wing violence.Trump's call to action was reminiscent of how, six weeks after losing the 2020 presidential election, he took to Twitter to urge his supporters to join a ""big protest"" in Washington, D.C. on January 6, 2021. ""Be there, will be wild!"" he wrote. Hundreds of far-right insurrectionists showed up and, after Trump told them to march from a rally near the White House to the Capitol, stormed the halls of Congress in a bid to prevent lawmakers from certifying President Joe Biden's win. Multiple people died as a result of the failed coup, which was fueled by Trump and his Republican allies' incessant lies about voter fraud.Trump is expected to be indicted by a Manhattan grand jury in a criminal case involving hush money paid to women who said they had sexual encounters with the former president, but its timing is unclear.Just before 7:30 am ET on Saturday, Trump baselessly declared on Truth Social: ""Illegal leaks from a corrupt and highly political Manhattan district attorney's office... indicate that, with no crime being able to be proven... the far and away leading Republican candidate and former president of the United States of America will be arrested on Tuesday of next week. Protest, take our nation back!""Alluding to Trump's prior use of social media to provoke the Capitol attack, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington asked, ""Will Facebook, Twitter, and YouTube allow him to use their platforms to incite riots?""Mother Jones' D.C. bureau chief David Corn, meanwhile, noted that Trump has recently ""excused or dismissed the violence of January 6."" ""He is an authoritarian willing to (again) use violence for his own ends,"" Corn tweeted. ""That is a threat to the nation."" None — (@) As HuffPost's senior White House correspondent S.V. Dáte pointed out, ""The coup-attempting former president... began inciting civil unrest if prosecutors came after him more than a year ago.""At a January 2022 rally in Texas, Trump promised to pardon January 6 rioters if he wins in 2024 and urged huge protests if prosecutors investigating his effort to subvert the 2020 election and other alleged crimes try to bring charges.""If these radical, vicious, racist prosecutors do anything wrong or illegal, I hope we are going to have in this country the biggest protest we have ever had... in Washington, D.C., in New York, in Atlanta, and elsewhere because our country and our elections are corrupt,"" Trump told a crowd of his supporters 14 months ago.According to The New York Times:Early Saturday morning, there was little evidence yet that Mr. Trump's new demand for protests had been embraced by extremist groups.But Ali Alexander, a prominent organizer of ""Stop the Steal"" rallies after the 2020 election, reposted a message on his Telegram channel on Saturday suggesting that he supported mass protest to protect Mr. Trump.""Previously, I had said if Trump was arrested or under the threat of a perp walk, 100,000 patriots should shut down all routes to Mar-a-Lago,"" Mr. Alexander wrote. ""Now I’m retired. I'll pray for him though!""Lacking the platform provided by the White House or the machinery of a large political campaign, it is unclear how many people Mr. Trump is able to reach, let alone mobilize, using his Truth Social website.After the FBI in early August searched Trump's Mar-a-Lago palace and removed boxes of documents as part of a federal probe into the ex-president's handling of classified materials, many anonymous and some well-known reactionaries called for ""civil war"" on Twitter, patriots.win, and elsewhere.Three days later, Ricky Shiffer, a Trump loyalist with suspected ties to a far-right extremist group and an unspecified connection to the January 6 insurrection, was shot and killed by police after an hourslong standoff. Shiffer, wielding an AR-15 and a nail gun, allegedly attempted to break into the FBI's Cincinnati office and fled to a nearby field when he was unsuccessful.Meanwhile, Trump continued to lie about the Mar-a-Lago search on Truth Social, sparking an ""unprecedented"" surge in threats against FBI personnel and facilities.As Dáte noted on Saturday morning, many people downplayed warnings issued ahead of the January 6 assault.""Many of Trump's core supporters want authoritarianism,"" the journalist tweeted. ""They believe in neither democracy nor the rule of law."" None — (@) As the Times reported:Although prosecutors working for the [Manhattan] district attorney, Alvin L. Bragg, have signaled that an indictment of Mr. Trump could be imminent, there was no immediate indication as to why the former president appeared confident that he would be arrested Tuesday. People with knowledge of the matter have said that at least one more witness is expected to testify in front of the grand jury, which could slightly delay any indictment.Three people close to Mr. Trump said that the former president's team had no specific knowledge about when an indictment might come or when an arrest could be anticipated. One of those people, who were not authorized to speak publicly, said that Mr. Trump's advisers' best guess was that it could happen around Tuesday, and that someone may have relayed that to him, but that they also had made clear to one another that they didn't know a specific time frame.Trump is expected to be charged in connection with payments his former lawyer, Michael Cohen, made to silence adult film actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal—both of whom alleged affairs with Trump—in the run-up to the 2016 presidential election.Cohen has testified that at Trump's direction, he orchestrated payments totaling $280,000 to Daniels and McDougal. According to Cohen, the Trump Organization reimbursed him $420,000 and classified it as a legal fee. Trump's former fixer pleaded guilty to federal campaign violations in 2018.Trump has so far evaded charges but that could soon change, as prosecutors are expected to accuse Trump of greenlighting the false recording of expenses in his company's internal records.Citing five unnamed officials familiar with the matter, NBC News reported Friday that local, state, and federal law enforcement and security agencies are preparing for the possibility of a Trump indictment as early as next week.If indicted, Trump would become the first U.S. president to face criminal charges in or out of office. Trump, who has denied all wrongdoing, says that he will keep campaigning regardless of whether he is arrested.The Manhattan D.A.'s hush money probe is just one of Trump's many legal woes. The twice-impeached president is also facing a state-level criminal investigation in Georgia over his efforts to overturn that state's 2020 election results, as well as federal probes into his coup attempt and his handling of classified government documents.Nevertheless, Trump is still seen as the front-runner to win the GOP's 2024 nomination. David Aronberg, the state attorney for Palm Beach County, Florida, said Saturday morning that if Trump is indicted in New York, ""there will be protests here,"" warning: ""You have to worry about potential violence.""He pointed out that questions remain as to whether Trump would surrender to New York authorities or face extradition.

80,DeSantis,2023-03-21,"""DeSantis Privately Called for Google to Be “Broken Up”""","by Andy Kroll, ProPublica, and Nick Surgey, Documented ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. Florida governor Ron DeSantis has frequently railed against “Big Tech.” He has accused Google, Facebook and Twitter of silencing conservative voices. But in private, DeSantis has gone even further. In previously unreported comments made in 2021, DeSantis said technology companies like Google “should be broken up” by the U.S. government. DeSantis, widely considered a presidential hopeful, made the remarks at an invite-only retreat for the Teneo Network, a “private and confidential” group for elite conservatives. ProPublica and Documented obtained video of the event. “They’re just too big, they have too much power,” DeSantis said. “I think they’re exercising a more negative influence on our society than the trusts that got broken up at the early 20th century.” He added that large tech companies “are ruining our country. They’re a very negative influence. And so I think you need to be strong about it.” DeSantis’ call to break up large tech companies occurred at the Teneo Network’s annual retreat in 2021. As ProPublica and Documented recently reported, the Teneo Network aims to “crush liberal dominance” across many areas of American society, according to its chairman Leonard Leo, the influential legal activist and longtime leader of the Federalist Society. DeSantis’ office did not respond to requests seeking comment. Teneo declined to comment. In recent years, “Big Tech” has emerged as a favored target for Republican lawmakers and activists, even as prominent conservatives have amassed huge followings on Twitter, Facebook and other platforms. Pointing to such high-profile examples as Donald Trump’s suspension from Facebook and Twitter’s decision to briefly block a story about Hunter Biden’s laptop, Republicans claim that U.S. tech companies have systematically suppressed conservative viewpoints and interfered with elections in ways that have helped Democrats. A 2021 study issued by New York University researchers concluded those assertions were baseless. “The claim of anti-conservative animus on the part of social media companies is itself a form of disinformation: a falsehood with no reliable evidence to support it,"" the researchers for the NYU Stern Center for Business and Human Rights wrote. Liberal lawmakers and policy experts have also called for stronger antitrust enforcement of major tech companies. During the 2020 presidential race, Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Mass., campaigned on a platform of breaking up Amazon, Facebook and Google, saying they had “too much power over our economy, our society, and our democracy.” In 2021, Democrats in Congress introduced legislation to split up tech firms, but the bills never became law. Matt Stoller, an antitrust expert who works at the American Economic Liberties Project, said it’s hard to tell if DeSantis’ private comments indicate genuine concern about corporate concentration of power or just anger at large firms perceived to be hostile to conservatives. “There’s a war on the right about antitrust,” Stoller said. “I’m skeptical but open-minded that DeSantis wants to do something serious about economic power.” Stoller added that he was more intrigued by DeSantis’ decision to call for breaking up tech at an event so closely associated with Leonard Leo. “If Leo buys that argument,” Stoller said, “then it means that a lot of federal judges might tip in that direction, too.” A spokesperson for Leo declined to comment. Teneo’s retreats are invite-only affairs limited to its members, their spouses and special guests. ProPublica and Documented obtained a video of DeSantis’ remarks about big tech, which took place during a longer conversation between DeSantis and Vivek Ramaswamy, a biotech entrepreneur who is now running for president as a Republican. Watch Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis Talk About Breaking Up Big Tech (Teneo) Watch video ➜ As governor, DeSantis has repeatedly singled out tech and social-media companies, saying their actions “may be one of the most pervasive threats to American self-government in the 21st century.” Legislation he signed in May 2021 not only seeks to give Floridians the ability to sue tech companies and win monetary damages, it also empowers the state’s attorney general to bring cases against tech companies under the Florida Deceptive and Unfair Trade Practices Act. (Tech companies are challenging the law, and its fate remains unclear.) In February of this year, DeSantis introduced a plan to create what he called a Digital Bill of Rights for Florida citizens. The proposal, billed as a way to protect privacy and eliminate “unfair censorship,” would ban TikTok on state government devices and block local and state employees “from coordinating with Big Tech companies to censor protected speech.” But unlike some of his fellow conservatives, DeSantis’ barbed public remarks about big tech have stopped short of urging the U.S. government to break up those tech companies. In his new book, “The Courage to Be Free,” he makes only a passing reference to “enforcing antitrust laws” against “large corporations that are wielding what is effectively public power.” In his remarks at the Teneo Network retreat, DeSantis described tech companies as “monopolies” that “have more power over our lives than the monopolies of the early 20th century ever had. And it’s not even close.” He listed tech companies’ extensive data collection practices and their ability to shape “core political speech” as evidence of big tech’s monopolistic powers. (Teneo) Watch video ➜ He went on to say that tech platforms “enforce their terms unevenly,” adding that “if you have a conservative viewpoint, you’re much more likely to get censored, you’re much more likely to get deplatformed.” And in response to critics who might say it’s not the role of government at any level to insert itself into the workings of a private business, DeSantis offered a sharp rebuttal. “Protecting the rights of folks to participate in political speech, I think, is an absolutely appropriate role of government,” he said. “And I think that we should do all that we can.” When pressed by Ramaswamy onstage about using government power to shrink big tech companies, DeSantis stood by his position. “Those big companies are basically an arm of the ruling regime,” he said. “Yeah, that should be something that should be done.” And when asked if he feared that breaking up U.S. companies would strengthen China’s position in global markets, DeSantis appeared unbothered, saying that he believed antitrust action was still the correct course. “These tech companies are ruining our country,” he said. “They’re a very negative influence. You need to be strong about it. And so that would not be the biggest concern I would have. My concern would be not having massive concentrations of power that are capable of silencing dissent, enforcing an orthodoxy and obviously interfering in elections, which we saw they did in 2020.” Do you have information about Leonard Leo or the Teneo Network that we should know?

81,DeSantis,2023-03-21,"""In America's Creed, Blessed Are the Warmakers""","In April 1953, newly elected President Dwight D. Eisenhower, a retired five-star Army general who had led the landings on D-Day in France in June 1944, gave his most powerful speech. It would become known as his “Cross of Iron” address. In it, Ike warned of the cost humanity would pay if Cold War competition led to a world dominated by wars and weaponry that couldn’t be reined in. In the immediate aftermath of the death of Soviet dictator Josef Stalin, Ike extended an olive branch to the new leaders of that empire. He sought, he said, to put America and the world on a “highway to peace.” It was, of course, never to be, as this country’s emergent military-industrial-congressional complex (MICC) chose instead to build a militarized (and highly profitable) highway to hell.Eight years later, in his famous farewell address, a frustrated and alarmed president called out “the military-industrial complex,” prophetically warning of its anti-democratic nature and the disastrous rise of misplaced power that it represented. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry, fully engaged in corralling, containing, and constraining it, he concluded, could save democracy and bolster peaceful methods and goals. The MICC’s response was, of course, to ignore his warning, while waging a savage war on communism in the name of containing it. In the process, atrocious conflicts would be launched in Vietnam, Laos, and Cambodia as the contagion of war spread. Threatened with the possibility of peace in the aftermath of the Soviet Union’s collapse in 1991, the MICC bided its time with operations in Iraq (Desert Storm), Bosnia, and elsewhere, along with the expansion of NATO, until it could launch an unconstrained Global War on Terror in the aftermath of the attacks of September 11, 2001. Those “good times” (filled with lost wars) lasted until 2021 and the chaotic U.S. withdrawal from Afghanistan.Only Americans, Ike once said, can truly hurt America. Meaning, to put the matter in a more positive context, only we can truly help save America. A vital first step is to put the word “peace” back in our national vocabulary.Not to be deterred by the fizzling of the nightmarish war on terror, the MICC seized on a “new cold war” with China and Russia, which only surged when, in 2022, Vladimir Putin so disastrously invaded Ukraine (as the U.S. had once invaded Afghanistan and Iraq). Yet again, Americans were told that they faced implacable foes that could only be met with overwhelming military power and, of course, the funding that went with it — again in the name of deterrence and containment. In a way, in 1953 and later in 1961, Ike, too, had been urging Americans to launch a war of containment, only against an internal foe: what he then labeled for the first time “the military-industrial complex.” For various reasons, we failed to heed his warnings. As a result, over the last 70 years, it has grown to dominate the federal government as well as American culture in a myriad of ways. Leaving aside funding where it’s beyond dominant, try movies, TV shows, video games, education, sports, you name it. Today, the MICC is remarkably uncontained. Ike’s words weren’t enough and, sadly, his actions too often conflicted with his vision (as in the CIA’s involvement in a coup in Iran in 1953). So, his worst nightmare did indeed come to pass. In 2023, along with much of the world, America does indeed hang from a cross of iron, hovering closer to the brink of nuclear war than at any time since the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962.Updating Ike’s Cross of Iron Speech for TodayPerhaps the most quoted passage in that 1953 speech addressed the true cost of militarism, with Ike putting it in homespun, easily grasped, terms. He started by saying, “Every gun that is made, every warship launched, every rocket fired signifies, in the final sense, a theft from those who hunger and are not fed, those who are cold and are not clothed.” (An aside: Can you imagine Donald Trump, Joe Biden, or any other recent president challenging Pentagon spending and militarism so brazenly?)Ike then added: “This world in arms is not spending money alone. It is spending the sweat of its laborers, the genius of its scientists, the hopes of its children. The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick school in more than 30 cities. It is two electric power plants, each serving a town of 60,000 population. It is two fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some fifty miles of concrete pavement. We pay for a single fighter plane with a half million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 8,000 people.” He concluded with a harrowing image: “This is not a way of life at all, in any true sense. Under the cloud of threatening war, it is humanity hanging from a cross of iron.”Ike’s cost breakdown of guns versus butter, weapons versus civilian goods, got me thinking recently: What would it look like if he could give that speech today? Are we getting more bang for the military megabucks we spend, or less? How much are Americans sacrificing to their wasteful and wanton god of war?Let’s take a closer look. A conservative cost estimate for one of the Air Force’s new “heavy” strategic nuclear bombers, the B-21 Raider, is $750 million. A conservative estimate for a single new fighter plane, in this case the F-35 Lightning II, is $100 million. A single Navy destroyer, a Zumwalt-class ship, will be anywhere from $4 to $8 billion, but let’s just stick with the lower figure. Using those weapons, and some quick Internet sleuthing, here’s how Ike’s passage might read if he stood before us now: “The cost of one modern heavy bomber is this: a modern brick-veneer and reinforced concrete school in 75 cities. It is five electric power plants, each serving a town with 60,000 inhabitants. It is five fine, fully equipped hospitals. It is some 150 miles of pavement. We pay for a single fighter plane with more than 12 million bushels of wheat. We pay for a single destroyer with new homes that could have housed more than 64,000 people.” (Quick and dirty figures for the calculations above: $10 million per elementary school; $150 million per power plant [$5,000/kilowatt for 30,000 homes]; $150 million per hospital; $5 million per new mile of road; $8 per bushel of wheat; $250,000 per home for four people.)Grim stats indeed! Admittedly, those are just ballpark figures, but taken together they show that the tradeoff between guns and butter — bombers and jet fighters on the one hand, schools and hospitals on the other — is considerably worse now than in Ike’s day. Yet Congress doesn’t seem to care, as Pentagon budgets continue to soar irrespective of huge cost overruns and failed audits (five in a row!), not to speak of failed wars.Without irony, today’s MICC speaks of “investing” in weapons, yet, unlike Ike in 1953, today’s generals, the CEOs of the major weapons-making corporations, and members of Congress never bring up the lost opportunity costs of such “investments.” Imagine the better schools and hospitals this country could have today, the improved public transportation, more affordable housing, even bushels of wheat, for the cost of those prodigal weapons and the complex that goes with them. And perish the thought of acknowledging in any significant way how so many of those “investments” have failed spectacularly, including the Zumwalt-class destroyers and the Navy’s Freedom-class littoral combat ships that came to be known in the Pentagon as “little crappy ships.”Speaking of wasteful warships, Ike was hardly the first person to notice how much they cost or what can be sacrificed in building them. In his prescient book The War in the Air, first published in 1907, H.G. Wells, the famed author who had envisioned an alien invasion of Earth in The War of the Worlds, denounced his own epoch’s obsession with ironclad battleships in a passage that eerily anticipated Ike’s powerful critique:The cost of those battleships, Wells wrote, must be measured by: “The lives of countless men… spent in their service, the splendid genius and patience of thousands of engineers and inventors, wealth and material beyond estimating; to their account we must put stunted and starved lives on land, millions of children sent to toil unduly, innumerable opportunities of fine living undeveloped and lost. Money had to be found for them at any cost—that was the law of a nation’s existence during that strange time. Surely they were the weirdest, most destructive and wasteful megatheria in the whole history of mechanical invention.” Little could he imagine our own era’s “wasteful megatheria.” These days, substitute nuclear intercontinental ballistic missiles, strategic bombers, aircraft carriers, and similar “modern” weapons for the ironclads of his era and the sentiment rings at least as true as it did then. (Interestingly, all those highly touted ironclads did nothing to avert the disaster of World War I and had little impact on its murderous course or ponderous duration.)Returning to 1953, Eisenhower didn’t mince words about what the world faced if the iron cross mentality won out: at worst, nuclear war; at best, “a life of perpetual fear and tension; a burden of arms draining the wealth and labor of all peoples; a wasting of strength that defies the American system, or the Soviet system, or any system to achieve true abundance and happiness for the peoples of this earth.”Ike’s worst-case scenario grows ever more likely today. Recently, Russia suspended the START treaty, the final nuclear deal still in operation, that oversaw reductions in strategic nuclear weapons. Instead of reductions, Russia, China, and the United States are now pursuing staggering “modernization” programs for their nuclear arsenals, an effort that may cost the American taxpayer nearly $2 trillion over the coming decades (though even such a huge sum matters little if most of us are dead from nuclear war).In any case, the United States in 2023 clearly reflects Ike’s “cross of iron” scenario. It’s a country that’s become thoroughly militarized and so is slowly wasting away, marked increasingly by fear, deprivation, and unhappiness.It’s Never Too Late to Change CourseOnly Americans, Ike once said, can truly hurt America. Meaning, to put the matter in a more positive context, only we can truly help save America. A vital first step is to put the word “peace” back in our national vocabulary.“The peace we seek,” Ike explained 70 years ago, “founded upon a decent trust and cooperative effort among nations, can be fortified, not by weapons of war but by wheat and by cotton, by milk and by wool, by meat and timber and rice. These are words that translate into every language on earth. These are the needs that challenge this world in arms.”The real needs of humanity haven’t changed since Ike’s time. Whether in 1953 or 2023, more guns won’t serve the cause of peace. They won’t provide succor. They’ll only stunt and starve us, to echo the words of H.G. Wells, while imperiling the lives and futures of our children.This is no way of life at all, as Ike certainly would have noted, were he alive today.Which is why the federal budget proposal released by President Biden for 2024 was both so painfully predictable and so immensely disappointing. Calamitously so. Biden’s proposal once again boosts spending on weaponry and war in a Pentagon budget now pegged at $886 billion. It will include yet more spending on nuclear weapons and envisions only further perpetual tensions with “near-peer” rivals China and Russia.This past year, Congress added $45 billion more to that budget than even the president and the Pentagon requested, putting this country’s 2023 Pentagon budget at $858 billion. Clearly, a trillion-dollar Pentagon budget is in our collective future, perhaps as early as 2027. Perish the thought of how high it could soar, should the U.S. find itself in a shooting war with China or Russia (as the recent Russian downing of a U.S. drone in the Black Sea brought to mind). And if that war were to go nuclear…The Pentagon’s soaring war budget broadcast a clear and shocking message to the world. In America’s creed, blessed are the warmakers and those martyrs crucified on its cross of iron.This was hardly the message Ike sought to convey to the world 70 years ago this April. Yet it’s the message the MICC conveys with its grossly inflated military budgets and endless saber-rattling.Yet one thing remains true today: it’s never too late to change course, to order an “about-face.” Sadly, lacking the wisdom of Dwight D. Eisenhower, such an order won’t come from Joe Biden or Donald Trump or Ron DeSantis or any other major candidate for president in 2024. It would have to come from us, collectively. It’s time to wise up, America. Together, it’s time to find an exit ramp from the highway to hell that we’ve been on since 1953 and look for the on-ramp to Ike’s highway to peace.And once we’re on it, let’s push the pedal to the metal and never look back.",Common Dreams,Top,No,32.27648749122968,98.03112122211223,16.83102957315815,83.06468116093693,72.05680216411561,51.60379206933452,america creed,{},"{'general': 'retired', 'speech': 'powerful', 'aftermath': 'immediate', 'dictator': 'soviet', 'branch': 'olive', 'leaders': 'new', 'complex': 'industrial', 'highway': 'militarized', 'address': 'famous', 'president': 'recent', 'nature': 'democratic', 'rise': 'disastrous', 'power': 'electric', 'citizenry': 'knowledgeable', 'methods': 'peaceful', 'war': 'shooting', 'conflicts': 'atrocious', 'times': 'good', 'wars': 'failed', 'withdrawal': 'chaotic', 'context': 'positive', 'step': 'first', 'vocabulary': 'national', 'foes': 'implacable', 'foe': 'internal', 'time': 'strange', 'reasons': 'various', 'years': 'last', 'government': 'federal', 'culture': 'american', 'nightmare': 'worst', 'passage': 'quoted', 'cost': 'true', 'sense': 'true', 'bomber': 'heavy', 'school': 'elementary', 'hospitals': 'equipped', 'pavement': 'concrete', 'plane': 'single', 'destroyer': 'single', 'homes': 'new', 'image': 'harrowing', 'goods': 'civilian', 'bang': 'more', 'megabucks': 'military', 'look': 'closer', 'estimate': 'conservative', 'bombers': 'strategic', 'figure': 'lower', 'sleuthing': 'quick', 'mile': 'new', 'stats': 'people.)grim', 'figures': 'ballpark', 'overruns': 'huge', 'audits': 'failed', 'corporations': 'making', 'costs': 'lost', 'investments': 'such', 'schools': 'better', 'transportation': 'public', 'housing': 'affordable', 'weapons': 'nuclear', 'way': 'significant', 'ships': 'crappy', 'warships': 'wasteful', 'person': 'first', 'author': 'famed', 'invasion': 'alien', 'battleships': 'ironclad', 'critique': 'powerful', 'men': 'countless', 'genius': 'splendid', 'opportunities': 'innumerable', 'living': 'undeveloped', 'megatheria': 'wasteful', 'history': 'whole', 'invention': 'mechanical', 'era': 'own', 'missiles': 'true', 'ironclads': 'touted', 'impact': 'little', 'course': 'murderous', 'fear': 'perpetual', 'system': 'soviet', 'abundance': 'true', 'case': 'worst', 'deal': 'nuclear', 'reductions': 'oversaw', 'programs': 'staggering', 'arsenals': 'nuclear', 'taxpayer': 'american', 'decades': 'coming', 'sum': 'huge', 'peace': '“the', 'trust': 'decent', 'effort': 'cooperative', 'needs': 'real', 'guns': 'more', 'proposal': 'federal', 'spending': 'more', 'tensions': 'perpetual', 'peer': 'near', 'year': 'past', 'future': 'collective', 'downing': 'russian', 'budget': 'soaring', 'message': 'clear', 'budgets': 'military', 'candidate': 'major'}",0,1

But to defeat nefarious wokeness, they first must define it. Their latest effort: ""So woke is...umm...sort of...like...the idea of..."" SAD!With a truck circling Mar-A-Golf quoting smirky Tucker's ""I hate him passionately,"" new legal losses daily arriving, and new scathing hashtags gaily trending - #TrumpCrimeFamily and #GuiltyAsFuck - Trump and his ""mayonnaise legions"" continue to double down on the notion that any attack on him is an attack on our already crumbling Republic, never mind his lifetime of sordid grifts and crimes whose reckoning is long past due. In ceaseless, panicked posts, he's been painting a floridly dystopian portrait of a fictional nation ""NOW THIRD WORLD & DYING, AMERICAN PATRIOTS ARE BEING ARRESTED & HELD IN CAPTIVITY LIKE ANIMALS, WHILE CRIMINALS & LEFTIST THUGS ARE ALLOWED TO ROAM THE STREETS, KILLING & BURNING WITH NO RETRIBUTION, MILLIONS ARE FLOODING THROUGH OUR OPEN BOARDERS (sic), MANY FROM PRISONS & MENTAL INSTITUTIONS. CRIME & INFLATION ARE DESTROYING OUR VERY WAY OF LIFE."" Worst, here he is, the eternal victim and ""FAR & AWAY LEADING REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE & FORMER PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA,"" set upon by D.A. Alvin Bragg, a woke ""Soros Racist in Reverse,"" and America must ""PROTEST, PROTEST, PROTEST!!!"" he's being asked to play by the same rulebook as the rest of us, also please send money. In his latest (literally) dark diatribe, the ""fluorescent tangerine imbecile"" went all Pol Pot, declaiming that if/when elected he'll form a ""Truth & Reconciliation Commission to expose the hoaxes"" of the Deep State""; he'll also prosecute government leakers and move 100,000 government jobs out of DC to ""places filled with patriots who love America."" His sycophants in power, victims just like him, have duly echoed his grievances: Talk of an indictment for what is in fact a gazillion crimes and misdemeanors is ""unAmerican,"" ""an outrageous abuse of power,"" sheer political vengeance that ""follows the lead of Socialist dictators."" Oversight head James Comer babbles that Bragg is ""grossly overstepping his authority by two levels of government"" and the House is coming for him. Rand Paul says Bragg should be ""put in jail,"" and what obstruction of justice? Andy Biggs warns, “If they can come for Trump, they will come for you."" On the MAGA forum ""The Donald,"" frantic fans are promising ""Civil War 2.0,"" complete with a ""Patriot Moat"" around Mar-A-Lago. But with Jan. 6 trials and convictions ongoing - and Trump's absence from that event and its consequences often bitterly noted - the response is a tad muted. From Ali Alexander, a key organizer of rallies to overturn the election, ""Now I'm retired. I'll pray for him though!"" The GOP's desperate focus on the villainous Bragg, a ""woke"" Democrat they equate with being ""weak on crime,"" is part of an overarching War on Woke that's become the incoherent cornerstone of all their political machinations - their pot/kettle House hearings on government's ""weaponization,"" their multiple state laws to control books, kids, women in a life-or-death Culture War, their racist efforts to protect innocents from slavery-recognizing Woke Mobs - ""Woke supremacy is as bad as white supremacy"" - and their hopes to win elections through ugly, divisive, repeated use of a dog-whistle that means, ""This is really about smearing black, gay and other marginalized people who live the inequity we don't want to acknowledge, but if I said that I'd be called a bigot."" The fave-word--of-the-year rhetoric is everywhere. Ron Woke-ity-Woke DeSantis, its loudest purveyor, calls his state ""the place where woke goes to die,"" daily pushes fascist legislation to prove it, and warns if he loses his war against ""the woke mind-virus"" and a vast segment of our population, ""We're going to be living under an oppressive woke-ocracy."" Pompeo rants about ""the poisonous lie of equity wokeness and identity politics,"" Pence about ""a pernicious woke agenda designed to control the American people,"" Trump about ""woke tyranny."" During March Madness, the Heritage Foundation can even steer you safely to the most un-woke teams.In the most ludicrous manifestation of Woke lunacy, the right chose to blame excessive wokeness for last month's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank - did tellers wear Black Banks Matter t-shirts? - because we all know the gilded halls of capitalist finance have long been rife with radical, probably gay Trotskyites and it definitely had nothing to do with a 2018 banking deregulation law signed by Trump and lobbied for by bank president Gary Becker - a white man like the vast majority of Wall Street executives, investment bankers and other overlords of financial power. Still, an inane deluge charged the bank failed because they acknowledged diversity issues. Fox' Jesse Watters: ""This stupid bank (is) a woke Biden bank...They were holding seminars (on) National Pride Month."" James Comer: ""We see it now coming out they were one of the most woke banks."" DeSantis: ""They were so concerned with DEI (diversity, equity, inclusion) and all kinds of stuff (that) diverted from them focusing on their core mission."" Wall Street Journal op-ed: ""They had 1 Black, 1 LGBTQ+ and 2 Veterans on the board...The company may have been distracted by diversity demands."" The crazed conclusion: ""This is cultural and economic Marxism, there is no other way of putting it. This is where we are - this long march of Socialism through our institutions.""""Long march of Socialism?"" Try long distortion of language to co-opt and re-purpose terms - ""elite,"" ""freedom,"" ""pro-life,"" ""radical,"" ""equity,"" ""Critical Race Theory"" - to obscure their own bigotry. The right's attempt to lay the burden of a bank's failure, an innate, common, often cruel hazard of capitalism, on marginalized people follows a historically familiar playbook for faux populists famously perfected by the Nazis: Blame the powerless, who are secretly powerful. In their conflation of efforts to render society kinder, fairer and more empathetic with perfidy, writes Aaron Rupar, they prove the GOP remains ""the party of hate,"" intent on maintaining white patriarchal rule at any cost. Evidence of GOP efforts to ""cancel"" black, brown, poor, gay, trans etc home rule is overwhelming, from ID laws to redistricting to MAGA-izing school boards to literally erasing policies they don't like in Dem cities of color. The House voted to undo the D.C. City Council's re-write of its own criminal laws. State officials in Texas just announced they're taking over Houston's school system - 62% Latino, 22% Black, 8th largest in the country - to fight “woke education.” A new ""Jim Crow bill” will take some judicial and police power from black-majority Jackson, Miss. city officials and give it to GOP state legislators in a move Mayor Chokwe Antar Lumumba blasts as “plantation politics.” Etc etc.Still, words do matter. Before the right twisted it into a weapon to bludgeon Legos with disabilities and The Little Mermaid, “woke” had an actual meaning. It originated as Black vernacular for “alert to racial discrimination”; to “stay woke” was to be ""aware of the deceptions and tactics used to enforce racism.” Today, a majority of Americans can muster the brain-power to define woke as being ""informed, educated on, and aware of social injustices,"" which for us is kinda the same as being informed, educated on, and aware of living on Planet Earth. For the right, woke has become ""MAGA-ese for non-white,"" but they're caught in a pesky Catch-22: Because even they know they're not supposed to say that out loud, they struggle mightily to define what it is they hate. On Fox, it's murky: ""It could be a feeling, it could be a sense."" (Twitter: ""It could be a land shark, a trans werewolf, a smell, whatever scares you."") It's Pence on Trump: ""Nobody is above the law, but nobody is beneath the law either."" It's the guy asked by The Good Liars what CRT is: ""I dunno, but it definitely shouldn't be taught in schools."" It's right-wing sage Bethany Mandel, author of a book about woke indoctrination, asked what woke is: "" So, umm..."" And it's Trump, asked to request a prayer on a Pastors For Trump National Prayer Call, coming up blank, then claiming ""the radical left"" broke the phone connection. God works in mysterious ways. We hope She's working on an indictment next.

""The choice of what to read must be left to the reader or, in the case of children, to parents. That choice does not belong to self-appointed book police."" None — (@) The Office for Intellectual Freedom said that starting in 2021, a rising number of challenges began targeting large numbers of titles, suggesting they were coordinated efforts from national groups like Moms for Liberty. Previously, the vast majority of book challenges were focused on a single book to which a parent or group of parents objected.In 2022, 90% of the books challenged were part of attempts to censor multiple titles, the ALA reported. ""A book challenge is a demand to remove a book from a library's collection so that no one else can read it. Overwhelmingly, we're seeing these challenges come from organized censorship groups that target local library board meetings to demand removal of a long list of books they share on social media,"" said Caldwell-Stone. ""Their aim is to suppress the voices of those traditionally excluded from our nation's conversations, such as people in the LGBTQIA+ community or people of color.""In Florida, where Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis has led a nationwide effort by conservatives to keep public school students from learning accurate American history and discussing issues regarding the LGBTQ+ community, one county removed from school library shelves 176 books which have been held in storage since January 2022. The books include the children's books Hush! A Thai Lullaby, featuring a Thai mother and child, and Dim Sum for Everyone!, about a family eating in a Chinese restaurant. ""I've never seen anything like this,"" Caldwell-Stone told the Associated Press. ""The last two years have been exhausting, frightening, outrage-inducing.""People for the American Way called the association's data, collected from media reports and library professionals across the country, ""shocking but not surprising.""""The far right wants to turn back the clock on the freedom to read, teach, and learn,"" said the group. ""We won't stand for it."" The ALA report comes four months after voters in at least two U.S. towns voted to cut or eliminate funding for their public libraries in the wake of campaigns to ban books with LGBTQ+ themes. People in Jamestown Township, Michigan voted for a second time against a millage to fund 84% of their library's budget, dooming the facility to a likely closure in 2024. The vote followed a push by a local conservative group to remove the book Gender Queer: A Memoir. Craighead County Jonesboro Library in Arkansas lost 50% of its funding after ""librarians and library workers were labeled pornographers and pedophiles because of the books on their shelves"" that dealt with LGBTQ+ themes, as EveryLibrary Institute executive director John Chrastka told Publishers Weekly in November. A poll commissioned by the EveryLibrary Institute last year found that 75% of respondents were opposed to efforts to ban books, and across 16 states last fall, a majority of initiatives to pull funding from libraries failed. ""While a vocal minority stokes the flames of controversy around books, the vast majority of people across the nation are using life-changing services that public and school libraries offer,"" said ALA President Lessa Kanani'opua Pelayo-Lozada on Thursday.

128,DeSantis,2023-03-23,"""Critics Say DeSantis Move to Expand 'Don't Say Gay' Exposes Law's True Intentions""","Florida's Republican governor and presumed 2024 presidential candidate Ron DeSantis is moving to expand his state's prohibition on classroom discussions of sexual orientation and gender identity to all grades. White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre on Wednesday denounced DeSantis' effort to broaden what critics call the ""Don't Say Gay"" law, describing it as ""completely, utterly wrong."" Passed last year by Florida's GOP-controlled Legislature, the law forbids classroom instruction on sexual orientation and gender identity in grades K-3. The DeSantis administration's proposed rule change, first reported Tuesday by The Orlando Sentinel, would extend the ban on such lessons to grades 4-12, except when they are required by state standards or as part of a reproductive health course from which parents can choose to exclude their children. The proposal, introduced by DeSantis' Department of Education, goes even further than right-wing Florida lawmakers' current push to expand the law through grade 8 and does not require legislative approval. The state Board of Education—controlled by appointees of DeSantis and his predecessor, U.S. Sen Rick Scott (R-Fla.)—is set to vote on the measure at its April 19 meeting. ""Everything he does is about what can further his own career ambitions,"" Brandon Wolf of Equality Florida told The Associated Press on Wednesday, referring to DeSantis. ""And it's clear he sees the anti-LGBTQ movement as his vehicle to get him where he wants to go."" Florida's ""Don't Say Gay"" law has been widely condemned since it was first introduced last year. Opponents—including President Joe Biden, who called the measure ""hateful""—contend that it marginalizes LGBTQ+ people. ""Everything he does is about what can further his own career ambitions. And it's clear he sees the anti-LGBTQ movement as his vehicle to get him where he wants to go."" DeSantis' proposed expansion has confirmed critics' warnings that the law was never intended to ""protect kids,"" as proponents claimed, but rather to undermine support for LGBTQ+ rights and sow mistrust in public education to facilitate privatization. ""It was never about 'protecting children,'"" Alejandra Caraballo, a clinical instructor at the Harvard Law School Cyberlaw Clinic, wrote Wednesday on social media. ""It was always about eliminating LGBTQ people from public life and making it illegal to even discuss our existence.""That message was echoed by former Florida Rep. Carlos Guillermo Smith (D-49), who tweeted: ""It was never, ever, ever, ever about kindergarten through third grade. It was always about demonizing us and censoring LGBTQ people out of existence in our schools.""During her Wednesday press briefing, Jean-Pierre alluded to growing attacks on LGBTQ+ people and said that DeSantis' proposal reflects ""a disturbing and dangerous trend that we're seeing across the country.""Last month, PEN America revealed that GOP officials across the United States unveiled 84 educational gag orders during the first six weeks of 2023.As the free speech organization previously documented, Republican lawmakers introduced 190 bills designed to restrict the ability of educators and students to discuss the production of and resistance to myriad inequalities throughout U.S. history—including several proposals to create so-called ""tip lines"" that would enable parents to punish school districts or individual teachers—in dozens of states in 2021 and 2022. Over the past two years, 19 laws limiting the teaching of gender, sexuality, and racism were enacted in more than a dozen GOP-controlled states, plus eight measures imposed without legislation.This year alone, Florida's ""Don't Say Gay"" law has spawned at least 27 copycat bills in more than a dozen states, including several measures that would, as DeSantis is now proposing, censor instruction related to sexual orientation or gender identity at all grade levels.Opponents of Florida's law argue that ""its language—'classroom instruction,' 'age appropriate,' and 'developmentally appropriate'—is overly broad and subject to interpretation,"" AP reported. ""Consequently, teachers might opt to avoid the subjects entirely for fear of being sued, they say."" None — (@) In an opinion piece published last year, Washington Post columnist Greg Sargent argued that the nationwide surge in restrictive education legislation has ""an obvious purpose: to make teachers feel perpetually on thin ice, so they shy away from difficult discussions about our national past rather than risk breaking laws in ways they cannot themselves anticipate.""""But there's another, more pernicious goal driving these bills that might well succeed politically precisely because it remains largely unstated,"" Sargent continued. ""The darker underlying premise here is that these bills are needed in the first place, because subversive elements lurk around every corner in schools, looking to pervert, indoctrinate, or psychologically torture your kids.""The ""combination of... vagueness and punitive mechanisms such as rights of action and tip lines"" is intentionally designed to promote self-censorship, wrote Sargent. ""Precisely because teachers might fear that they can't anticipate how they might run afoul of the law—while also fearing punishment for such transgressions—they might skirt difficult subjects altogether.""He added that ""calls for maximal parental choice and control in schools have been used by the right for decades as a smoke screen to sow fears and doubts about public education at its ideological foundations.""National Education Association president Becky Pringle similarly argued last month that DeSantis' attack on a new high school Advanced Placement African-American studies course is part of the far-right's wider anti-democratic assault on public schools and other institutions aimed at improving the common good.""For DeSantis, blocking AP African-American studies is part of a cheap, cynical, and dangerous political ploy to drive division and chaos into public education debates,"" Pringle wrote.""He seeks to distract communities from his real agenda, which is to first whitewash and then dumb down public education as an excuse to privatize it,"" she added.

""Conservatives have weaponized hate and fear to try to tear our schools apart, with students who just want to learn and thrive turned into pawns in their political games.""Ninety percent of the attempted book bans were part of challenges to multiple books, suggesting they are increasingly being driven by right-wing groups such as Moms for Liberty instead of individual parents who have concerns. The ALA said this trend began in 2021, as Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis was pushing legislation to ban accurate classroom discussions about the history of racial injustice in the United States.Schools in Florida have now removed dozens of book titles from shelves, including The Life of Rosa Parks and Who Is the Dalai Lama? as officials assess whether the material is appropriate for children. ""Forty percent of banned books are reported as significantly addressing LGBT issues,"" said Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) on Thursday as the House debated the bill. ""When we talk about progressive values, I can say what my progressive value is and that is freedom over fascism."" None — (@) Speaking about marginalized people and children, Rep. Cori Bush (D-Mo.) said the legislation is the work of a political party that is ""trying to 'write us out' of the curriculum."" None — (@) Rep. Rashida Tlaib (D-Mich.) expressed outrage at the notion that Republicans are seeking to protect children by limiting their access to material dealing with LGBTQ+ issues and American history, considering that have blocked numerous pieces of gun control legislation even as gun violence has overtaken car accidents as the leading cause of death of children in the United States.""Since Columbine over 20 years ago, more than 344,000 students in our country have experienced gun violence at school,"" said Tlaib. ""Some of our children attend schools with unsafe drinking water. Others go to school in districts attempting to erase Black history from our classrooms by banning books like The Life of Rosa Parks. These are some of the real obstacles to our children thriving.""""When this bill was considered in committee, Democrats offered amendments that would keep firearms out of classrooms, remove lead pipes from our schools, and prevent censorship of Black history. But every single amendment aimed at the real threats to our children was voted down by these MAGA Republicans,"" she added. ""It makes me angry to see how conservatives have weaponized hate and fear to try to tear our schools apart, with students who just want to learn and thrive turned into pawns in their political games.""The National Education Association noted that the legislation, which the Democratic-led Senate is not expected to take up, offers solutions to a number of problems that don't widely exist and promotes a ""toxic vision of parental engagement"" in schools.The bill ""contains a list of provisions already ensured by local and state law, including, but not limited to, a parent's right to view a school's budget or speak at a public school board meeting,"" wrote Tim Walker, a senior writer for the organization.A survey released by Navigator this month showed that parents' top concerns about education are ""making sure their children learn what they need to be successful, keeping them safe from gun violence, and protecting their mental health"" and that having a ""say in what their kids are learning"" is not a high priority for a majority of parents. A poll by National Public Radio last year also found that 76% of parents believe their children's schools keep them well-informed about the curriculum and classroom activities.""At least in my experience, teachers have always been able to be accessible to parents, and I don't know what these parents' rights bills will do other than give more power and pathways to things like book banning and elimination of resources,"" York, Pennsylvania teacher Ben Hodge told Education Week recently. American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten said the bill is an example of ""divisive performance politics"" by the GOP. ""Every day in classrooms and communities around the country, parents and educators work tirelessly together to make the lives of our kids better and provide them with the knowledge they need to excel—with books, art, and music; tutoring programs and capstone projects; and counseling to help them navigate life, tackle challenges, and deal with trauma,"" said Weingarten.

His performance over the last couple of weeks has not instilled confidence. We’ve watched him flip-flop on everything from cutting entitlement programs, to his support of Ukraine. We have also seen Trump belittle him with nicknames like “Ron DeSanctimonious” and “Meatball Ron,” not to mention implying that he’s a “groomer.” (DeSantis also just denied an anecdote in a Daily Beast report that he once ate pudding with three fingers on a private flight. Gross.)This erratic behavior seems to have left a mark. As The New York Times’ Nate Cohn wrote last week, “In surveys taken since the Trump offensive began two months ago, Mr. DeSantis, the Florida governor, has steadily lost ground against Mr. Trump, whose own numbers have increased.” And that was before DeSantis tried to have it both ways regarding the potential arrest of Donald Trump. (He criticized the prosecutor, while adding, “I don’t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair.”)But I’m more moved by what is admittedly anecdotal: the vibes.

While they bear DeSantis’ imprimatur, many of the bills’ specifics, both large and small, are lifted directly from the anti-union playbook of the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC), a pay-to-play operation in which state legislators and corporate lobbyists meet behind closed doors to write model legislation.The bills also have the backing of billionaire-bankrolled conservative think tanks that anti-worker lawmakers often call on for support, including Charles Koch’s astroturf group Americans for Prosperity (AFP) and State Policy Network (SPN) affiliates the James Madison Institute and the Freedom Foundation.If passed, the bills would empower the state of Florida to decertify public sector unions, prohibit automatic deductions for union dues, mandate universal language on union membership cards, and impose considerable annual reporting requirements. “Gov. DeSantis says he supports ‘teacher empowerment,’ but this bill does the exact opposite,” the president of the Florida Education Association, Andrew Spar, said in a statement. “It’s an attack, pure and simple, on educators’ basic freedoms and rights.”Perhaps the most consequential provision of the proposed legislation is its introduction of a new membership threshold for union decertification. The bills would require public sector unions to report their membership numbers to the state annually, a process that would lead to the potential decertification of any unions in which membership drops below 60% of eligible workers.Under current Florida law, a decertification vote can only be triggered if at least 30% of a bargaining unit’s eligible workers file a petition calling for the vote.The exception is teachers unions. Since the passage of a 2018 law, Florida teachers are the only public sector union members who are required to report their membership numbers annually. If their membership falls below a minimum of 50% of eligible workers, the union is forced to hold a decertification election.The new legislation would impose these annual reporting requirements and the 60% membership threshold on all public sector unions, with the exception of those of police, firefighters, and corrections officers.ALEC has long advocated for increasing the membership threshold for unions. The Center for Media and Democracy (CMD) has previously reported on ALEC’s model Union Recertification Act, which requires decertification of a union if membership drops below 50%, and also requires a secret ballot election every two years. As a “right-to-work” state, Florida allows teachers and other public sector workers to avoid paying union dues while benefiting from the better pay and working conditions that the union negotiates, which undermines the ability of unions to build their membership. A CMD analysis of information provided by Florida’s Public Employees Relations Commission (PERC) demonstrates what’s at stake if the higher membership threshold in the proposed bills passes. In fiscal year 2021–22, there were 44 public teachers’ unions in the state with a membership density between 50 and 60%. Under the new legislation, the unions covering these workers—114,854 public school teachers, which amounts to 62% of the entire statewide unionized public teacher workforce—would be forced to petition PERC for recertification and hold time-consuming new elections, or else risk being decertified.Although the Senate’s fiscal analysis considered the density of teachers’ unions, it appears that it did not take into account the density of other public sector unions.The Senate bill would also prohibit the automatic deduction of union dues. This provision—which in ALEC’s articulation has taken the form of the Public Employer Payroll Deduction Policy Act and is continually recycled in other model bills, such as the Public Employee Freedom Act—would require public sector employees to grant permission every year to allow their dues to be deducted from their paychecks.The proposed legislation would also mandate that each public sector union card include anti-union language acknowledging that Florida is a right-to-work state, that union membership and dues payment are voluntary, and that “no employee may be discriminated against” for not joining a union. This idea—along with most of the language in the bill—parrots ALEC’s model Public Employee Rights and Authorization Act.Under current Florida law, the state does not stipulate that membership cards include any specific information or statements.While ALEC’s model bill calls for this information to be “written in bold and in all caps” and printed in “a font that is equal to or larger than any other font found in the body of the form,” the Florida bill stipulates that it be printed in “14-point type.”Coordinated Efforts to Undermine WorkersLast but not least, the bills include substantial annual reporting requirements. Each union will be required to provide an “annual audited financial report that includes a detailed breakdown of revenues and expenditures,” audited membership lists, all bylaws, officers’ salaries, and other information. This provision draws heavily from ALEC’s Union Financial Responsibility Act, a model bill that requires public sector unions to file extensive financial and operational reports every year.All in all, the Florida House estimates that its bill will cost the state an additional $903,238 each year to enforce, according to its internal fiscal analysis.The proposed legislation—which carves out exemptions for law enforcement officers, correctional officers, and fire fighters—has drawn intense criticism from workers’ rights advocates. An overwhelming majority of the public attending a House committee meeting on March 16—102 of the 112 non-legislators in the room—were opposed to the bill. The handful of attendees who were proponents largely represented conservative think tanks. Among those speaking in favor of the legislation at the House committee meeting were Sal Nuzzo, a vice president at the Madison Institute and chair of an ALEC task force, and Christopher Stranburg, AFP’s state legislative affairs director in Florida. Representative Spencer Roach (R-79), who voted in favor of the House bill in committee, is ALEC’s Florida state chair, and a handful of other legislators who have moved the bill out of committee have ties to ALEC. Registered lobbyists for the Senate bill include AFP, the National Federation of Independent Business (NFIB), and the Foundation for Florida’s Future, Jeb Bush’s pro-charter school 501c4. Lobbyists for the House bill include representatives from the Opportunity Solutions Project, the action-arm of right-wing think tank Foundation for Government Accountability (FGA); the Washington-based Freedom Foundation; the Center for Worker Progress Action (related to the Mackinac Center in Michigan); and additional lobbyists from NFIB and AFP. FGA, the Freedom Foundation, and the Mackinac Center are state affiliates of SPN, the web of right-wing think tanks and tax-exempt organizations pushing far-right policy agendas throughout the U.S., Canada, and the U.K. AFP and NFIB are associate members.An internal SPN document provided by CMD to The Guardian in 2017 revealed SPN’s plan to work to “defund and defang” public sector unions. As articulated by SPN’s President and CEO Tracie Sharp, the goal is “permanently depriving the left from access to millions of dollars in dues extracted from unwilling union members every election cycle.”State Senator Blaise Ingoglia (R-11) and State Representative Dean Black (R-15) sponsored the bills, and committee votes in both chambers have been almost entirely along party lines. A single Republican state senator, Corey Simon (R-3), voted against the Senate bill.The Senate bill was debated as a high-priority “special order calendar” item on Thursday, and will be taken up again when the Senate returns on March 29. The House bill is being reviewed by the State Affairs committee. Given the Republican’s supermajority in the legislature, the bills are expected to become law.",Common Dreams,Top,Yes,31.554755514679705,97.56247703500182,95.36958874368526,79.8260741626877,72.9051995106365,80.29540251429636,ron desantis,{},"{'session': 'legislative', 'regulations': 'new', 'activists': 'union', 'wins': 'huge', 'list': 'labor', 'playbook': 'union', 'lobbyists': 'additional', 'doors': 'closed', 'tanks': 'conservative', 'lawmakers': 'worker', 'sector': 'public', 'deductions': 'automatic', 'language': 'union', 'requirements': 'annual', 'opposite': 'exact', 'attack': 'pure', 'freedoms': 'basic', 'provision': 'consequential', 'legislation': 'proposed', 'threshold': 'higher', 'decertification': 'potential', 'workers': 'other', 'law': 'current', 'members': 'unwilling', 'election': 'secret', 'pay': 'better', 'bills': 'other', 'year': 'fiscal', 'teachers': 'workers—114,854', 'school': 'charter', 'workforce': 'entire', 'teacher': 'public', 'elections': 'new', 'analysis': 'fiscal', 'unions': 'other', 'deduction': 'automatic', 'information': 'other', 'font': 'other', 'report': 'financial', 'breakdown': 'detailed', 'reports': 'financial', 'officers': 'correctional', 'criticism': 'intense', 'majority': 'overwhelming', 'affairs': 'legislative', 'legislators': 'other', 'wing': 'right', 'organizations': 'exempt', 'agendas': 'right', 'senator': 'republican', 'priority': 'high', 'order': 'special'}",0,1

167,DeSantis,2023-03-25,"""Banning Eagle Song, Dragons Love Tacos, A Thai Lullaby and Pink! To Protect the Children""","The zealots are out in force these days, feverishly banning pernicious texts like Sneezy the Snowman, Grandmama's Pride, A Storm Called Katrina and Dim Sun For Everyone because they're ""putting children at risk"" while they quietly sit through their live-shooter drills. Happily, some are calling out concerns ""their kids’ minds may be opened by a book."" Among them is Grace Linn, 100, whose husband died long ago fighting her era's brownshirts. ""Fear is not freedom,"" she says. ""Fear is control."" The nationwide rush to ""protect the innocence of children"" from the perils of thinking for themselves accelerated this week when the GOP-led House passed a so-called Parents Bill of Rights Act requiring public schools to provide parents with a list of books in school libraries, including those about icky subjects like racial equality, gender identity or sexy-time stuff. At the same time, GOP lawmakers declined to make children safer from lead-tainted water or AR-15 assault rifles - even though in the last 20 years over 344,000 students have experienced gun violence and last year alone saw a record 51 school shootings even as the GOP passed 20 laws in 13 states to weaken gun laws - because they rejected all the Democratic amendments aimed at doing so. The bill's passage came a day after the American Library Association (ALA) released a report citing 2022's record-breaking 2,571 book titles challenged or removed - up 38% from the year before, and the highest level of censorship since tracking began 20 years ago. Oddly, most of the targeted books are by or about Black, Brown, LGBTQ and other marginalized people, thus suggesting, argues Cori Bush, a political party ""trying to write us out of the curriculum."" In the dubious race to a Fahrenheit 451 dystopia, Texas leads in bans - 801 - but Florida, with 566 bans and 8 million fewer people, is the belly of the totalitarian beast thanks to Ron 'Don't-Say-Gay-Or-Slavery' DeSantis. Under his draconian legislation, teachers/librarians must remove or cover any books ""harmful to minors"" that are not ""vetted"" by a trained ""media specialist,"" under surreal threat of ""30 days imprisonment"" for ""a felony of the third degree""; there's a 21-point list of procedures they must follow to ensure compliance. Among 176 books removed from Duval County: Hachiko: The True Story of a Loyal Dog, The Garden of My Imaan, Cow on the Town: Practicing the Ow Sound, Celia Cruz, Queen of Salsa, The Berenstein Bears and the Big Question, Grandfather Tang's Story, Running the Road to ABC, My Name Is Sally Little Song, 14 Cows For America, Hush: A Thai Lullaby, Lost and Found Cat: The True Story of Kunkush’s Incredible Journey, Never Say A Mean Word Again, A Storm Called Katrina, Sally and The Magical Sneeze, Malala: A Hero for All, Unusual Chickens for the Exceptional Poultry Farmer, Lailah’s Lunchbox: A Ramadan Story, Pink! A teacher who posted a video of empty library shelves - which DeSantis has denied - was fired for ""misrepresentation of books available to students (and) the disruption this misrepresentation has caused,” or Fascism 101. Likewise in Florida's Manattee County, teachers had to remove The Life of Rosa Parks, Dragons Love Tacos, Sneezy the Snowman, Fry Bread: A Native American Family Story, Who Is the Dalai Lama?, Unstoppable: How Jim Thorpe and the Carlisle Indian School Football Team Defeated Army, along with the perennially banned Gender Queer: A Memoir, Toni Morrison's The Bluest Eye and Beloved,, and All Boys Aren't Blue. Not coincidentally, restoring access to books is a long, slow, laborious process wherein each book in each classroom of 64 schools with 3,000 teachers must be cross-checked with a district-wide catalogue; the task of reviewing thousands of books falls to one ""media specialist"" in each school, notes one teacher, ""and they are human."" Adding insult to free speech injury, the policy of ""fear-based decisions that prioritize staying in good favor with the Governor over doing the right thing for our students"" was enacted in January, just in time for ""Literacy Week."" The resulting ""travesty"" of empty shelves - or those covered in construction paper and students' signs pleading ""Free the Books!"" - have led some distraught teachers to speak up. ""My heart is broken for Florida students today as I am forced to pack up my classroom library,"" wrote one. ""Farewell, classroom library. We'll see you soon, I promise."" Alarmingly but unsurprisingly, book bans are increasingly orchestrated by fundamentalist groups like Moms for Liberty with ""a white Christian Nationalist spin,"" notes George Takei, whose own graphic memoir They Called Us Enemy, about his childhood spent in World War ll-era Japanese American internment camps, was banned in 2021. Since then, those groups and their MAGA-decibel rants have soared. Today, they lean so far right even the principal of a conservative Christian school in Tallahassee just ran afoul of the righteous strictures when she brought a sixth-grade class studying Renaissance art to see Michaelangelo's statue of David, complete with a penis deemed ""pornographic"" by some appalled parents - because time flies, a scenario preposterously predicted by The Simpsons 30 years ago. The principal resigned in disgrace, the Board passed a new parental notification rule, and the school board chair gushingly praised DeSantis' “cutting edge” edicts: ""We agree with everything (he's) doing."" Still - hope springs eternal - not everyone in Florida does. Earlier this month, after the Martin County school district purged over 80 books, pissed parents packed a school board meeting after learning all the challenges came from one mom for ""liberty,"" who filed her complaints even though she ""did not actually read any of the books in question."" Julie Marshall, the aforementioned Mom for Holy Sanctity, stressed that while she did challenge all the unread books, she works with a yuge number of parents and even ""consulted with African-Americans and people of the Jewish faith."" She celebrated having removed ""the most obscene"" books, including a Holocaust novel and 20 other books by author Jodi Picoult, who noted many don't even contain a kiss. ""If you guys want to continue making me out to be the sole parent in all of this...so be it,"" retorted Marshall, who wore a t-shirt emblazoned with Wonder Woman, evidently unaware the character is a queer icon. ""Persecute me for standing on morality, I really don't care."" But many speakers objected to the ""borderline absurd"" challenges, arguing the offending authors ""helped me through adolescence,"" ""helped me understand I have privileges my Black peers do not enjoy,"" ""educated me on social issues,"" taught them ""we must understand one another."" One wise high school student, reminding them ""I am the reason you are here,"" called it ""ridiculous"" for one outlier to wield such power. ""If we don't learn about history, the good, the bad, the ugly, we are bound to repeat it,"" he argued. ""I encourage you to parent your children, but you cannot parent other people's children."" Like August Landmesser, the sole German shipyard worker famously documented in 1936 refusing to salute the Führer, many others are stepping up to halt the madness reminiscent of that era. They range from a slew of grassroots groups - the national Red, Wine & Blue, Florida's Freedom To Read Project, New-York-founded Defense of Democracy, the Run For Something advocacy group - to a parent protesting Utah's new law banning “pornographic or indecent” material by seeking to ban ""one of the most sex-ridden books around,"" the Bible. ""Incest, onanism, bestiality, prostitution, genital mutilation, fellatio, dildos, rape, and even infanticide,"" he recited of a book that ""should be a slam dunk"" for the ""white supremacist hate group"" that wants to ""protect the innocence of children."" ""Get this PORN out of our schools!"" Finally, there is Grace Linn, who came to Martin County's meeting bearing a quilt she made of censored titles: Maus, Fahrenheit 451, I Know Why the Caged Bird Sings, The Color Purple. ""My husband Robert Nichol was killed in action in World War II, at a very young age, only 26, defending our democracy, Constitution, and freedoms,"" she said, adding that ""one of the freedoms the Nazis crushed was the freedom to read."" They acted out of ""fear of knowledge,"" she noted, but ""fear is not liberty."" ""My husband died as a father of freedom. I am a mother of liberty,"" she declared. ""Banned books need to be proudly displayed and protected from school boards like this.""

171,DeSantis,2023-03-26,"""Vanity Fair’s Definition of Democracy: ”Solidarity and Collective Caretaking.” These Were the Very Slogans Used by Marxists""","At this point, talking about Covid may give you dry heaves, but the left wing media still loves it.  In recent Vanity Fair “Covid forever!” episode, the topic was “Anti-vaxxism” of Ron DeSantis:“He was for the COVID-19 vaccines before he was against them, but now Florida’s governor is all-in on vaccine skepticism—and hoping to use the issue to outflank Trump on the right.”Vanity Fair is appalled at Ron DeSantis’s “flip flopping.”  They are not so much concerned with Fauci’s, or other “experts.”  Remember how Fauci said masks were useless before they were lifesaving?  Or when getting a vax meant you would not get Covid, before you could only get a mild case, before you needed 5 boosters?  Or when vaccines prevented the spread of Covid before they didn’t?  Or when Covid originated on the wet market before it originated in the lab?  You may have thought “the experts” were just putting their finger in the air to see where the wind blows – but resist the temptation to come to such conclusion.  “The experts” were right every time.   It’s  “the evolution of THE SCIENCE” that made them appear to look like fools.Now, Ron DeSantis is a very different matter.  When he backed the vaccines early on, it was not because they were sold by “the experts” as being “95% effective.”  Ron was only doing it “to share credit for a singular feat in President Donald Trump’s vaccine,” or something.  Of course, by August of 2021, the vaccines were proven to be much less effective than advertised.  But please resist the urge to think that this was the reason for the Governor’s policy.The only reason the Governor became “an anti-vaxxer” was because “anti-vaccine sentiment has surged among rank-and-file Republicans.”  Which, by the way, did not happen because the vaccines failed to perform as expected.  Even though we soon discovered that vaccines did not prevent you from getting Covid, or spreading it, “the sentiment” about them was never supposed to change (if you wanted to be friends with Vanity Fair, of course).  Because getting vaccinated was never a personal healthcare decision.  It was something you were required to do “out of solidarity.”Let’s hear from Vanity Fair’s favorite history scholar and resident communist, Ruth Ben-Ghiat:“Ruth Ben-Ghiat, a professor of history at New York University and author of Strongmen: Mussolini to the Present, sees DeSantis’s COVID-19 policies as part of his effort to use Florida as a testing ground for an American model of autocracy.  Wearing a mask or getting vaccinated are acts of collective caretaking, she says. “Autocrats want to turn everyone against each other. They don’t want you to have solidarity. They want radical individualism. It makes people paranoid of the federal government. The real goal is to elevate their own [power and judgment].”“Solidarity” is the concept that you know well if you have ever lived in a totalitarian country.  There was a big Government holiday, celebrated on May 1st, known as a day of “workers’ solidarity.”  “Solidarity,” which is a synonym of “unity,” was a famous Marxist slogan.   “Proletarians of all countries, unite!” may be familiar to you as well.  “Solidarity” and “the good of the collective” over individual rights is the hallmark of a totalitarian regime and is antithetical to a functioning Democracy.“Collective caretaking” is the term the Bolsheviks used when they stormed the homes of “kulaks,” killed them, confiscated their property, and distributed it to “the people.”  It resulted in massive starvation, killing millions.  “Collective caretaking” was the philosophy behind Stalin’s “enemies of the state” extermination of his own citizens.  “Collective caretaking” justifies any atrocity – because after all, it’s done “for the common good.”  A person identifying as “a history professor” should know that – but she would rather have you believe that it is ”radical individualism” that you should fear.US Constitution guarantees every American the right to pursue individual happiness.  There is a reason for that – happy people make productive and self-sustained members of society who are more inclined to help those less fortunate, leading to society’s benefit overall.  “Collective caretaking” under the barrel of a gun, as Ms.Ben-Ghiat, and her elitist media acolytes who want to run your life, are promoting, led to mass deaths in any country it has been tried.  And, as the experience in China shows us, it did not reduce Covid mortality in any way.Governor DeSantis left healthcare decisions up to the people, which it not the only Democratic way of governing, but also the most efficient way to reduce mortality.  Given extensive information (as opposed to the only side approved by Government) people will make the best decision for their families.  Treating people as the herd of uneducated bums who need to be told how to take care of themselves, as “the experts” have done, led not only to needless deaths, but also destroyed trust in medical profession for years to come.The media will continue to gaslight you into belief that a leader refusing to mandate a completely useless vaccine is a totalitarian dictator. ",Right Wire Report The Truth Be Told,Top,No,31.49862984153281,97.0783805462448,99.988812954265,79.57422305487913,74.27373165793138,66.80246088214474,vanity fair,{},"{'heaves': 'dry', 'wing': 'left', 'flopping': 'flip', 'experts': 'other', 'case': 'mild', 'market': 'wet', 'conclusion': 'such', 'matter': 'different', 'feat': 'singular', 'reason': 'only', 'sentiment': 'vaccine', 'decision': 'best', 'scholar': 'favorite', 'model': 'american', 'caretaking': 'collective', 'individualism': 'radical', 'government': 'federal', 'goal': 'real', 'power': 'own', 'country': 'totalitarian', 'holiday': 'big', 'slogan': 'marxist', 'rights': 'individual', 'regime': 'totalitarian', 'democracy': 'functioning', 'starvation': 'massive', 'citizens': 'own', 'good': 'common', 'happiness': 'individual', 'people': 'happy', 'members': 'productive', 'acolytes': 'elitist', 'deaths': 'needless', 'mortality': 'covid', 'way': 'efficient', 'information': 'extensive', 'side': 'only', 'bums': 'uneducated', 'profession': 'medical', 'vaccine': 'useless', 'dictator': 'totalitarian'}",0,1

178,DeSantis,2023-03-26,"""GOP Voters Keep Backing Trump Because He Hates the 'Right' People""","On a Saturday when dark clouds and even killer tornadoes were wending their way over huge swathes of the United States, the sun rose brightly over Waco. On a dusty patch of land in a central Texas town tagged by historic infamy, Donald Trump's army of supporters came early and in surprisingly large numbers on the first weekend of an uneasy American spring. In the shadow of massive pro-Trump flags—""Trump Or Death 1776 2024"" read one fastened to the front bumper of a blue Jeep—flew the undercurrent that the runaway front-runner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination has sparked in a recent speech. Call it vengeance, or retribution, or old-fashioned smiting your enemies. On this day, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg—the Black, progressive-minded prosecutor who may win an indictment of Trump as early as this week—was the new Public Enemy No. 1. ""Alvin Bragg is overstepping his boundaries,"" a man in a Trump hat, brandishing a T-shirt with a picture of the New York prosecutor reading ""ARREST ALVIN BRAGG,"" told a conservative news network. ""We the people are calling for the arrest of Alvin Bragg for crimes of treason and election interference—I don't even know if election interference is a crime—but election interference, obstruction of justice, even lying to a grand jury. Trump done nothing wrong. We're here to show support for the greatest president ever."" This random dude's words were echoed by the more powerful in attendance, such as Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who increasingly sits at the right hand of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. ""We have to stop allowing Democrats to abuse us,"" said Greene of Bragg, echoing the call for his arrest, while also calling him a puppet of Jewish billionaire George Soros in an antisemitic trope. She pled victimization: ""It's like we are a beaten spouse."" None — (@) Moments later, the jet rebranded as ""Trump Force One"" flew in for its dramatic landing, now accompanied by a favorite from the 1980s' Top Gun soundtrack. Kenny Loggins blared from the loudspeakers: ""Ride into the danger zone..."" Danger zone, indeed. Do not be fooled by the calming blue of a Texas big sky: the 747 of American democracy is flying on a collision course toward a steep mountainside. With the weight of four separate criminal probes dealing with Trump's outrageous behavior before, during and after his disastrous 45th presidency coming down on him, the hero of America's authoritarian right is gaining altitude in utter defiance of political gravity. With every headline about porn star payoffs, or threatening phone calls demanding that Georgia politicians find him votes, or a more aggressive federal investigation of his attempted coup on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump seems to rise another point or two in the polls—building a huge early lead in the race to win the GOP's 2024 White House nod. The only candidate who's shown signs of mounting an intraparty challenge—Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis—looks increasingly like a frozen deer on the Trump runway, unable to respond to attacks, caught between his me-too, Trump-lite policies and his need to appease traditional Republican fat cats and inside backers like Jeb Bush. No one knows how a scenario like this ends. But it clearly cannot end well. Will America really see a 2024 campaign where one party's leading candidate isn't jetting around to rallies on Trump Force One but instead is flown between courtrooms in New York, Atlanta, and Washington by armed marshals, wearing an ankle bracelet? And what if the Republican nominee is convicted? How serious to take Trump's prediction in a recent Truth Social post of ""potential death & destruction"" if he's charged? What to expect from fans vowing ""Trump or Death""? None — (@) ""They're not coming after me, they're coming after you,"" Trump said Saturday after ambling to the Waco stage, unveiling what ought to be his 2024 campaign slogan. The candidate's occasional rambles into policy—a likely abandonment of Ukraine's defense of democracy, or a fascist level of state control over the classroom—are not what this campaign is about. Trump's only real promise is a red wedding of revenge, against a ""deep state"" that ranges from the FBI to Covid bureaucrats, against the army of prosecutors who happen to be Black, against anybody really—school teachers and college professors, or white-coated doctors, or journalists—that people willing to stand for eight hours in Texas dust think are looking down on them. Why is this working? Don't ask the pundits who get paid a handsome six figures to talk about politics, who seem just as clueless today about Trump and, more importantly, his appeal—maybe more so—than when he cruised down that Trump Tower escalator in 2015. ""You know what I don't get, and I'm going to look stupid on TV for saying this, but I haven't gotten this for the last five or six years,"" John McWhorter, the Columbia University linguist and New York Times op-ed contributor, a frequent critic of the left, said recently on HBO's ""Real Time with Bill Maher."" ""Is it really true that there are really these people quote unquote sitting in diners with their hats on, et cetera, who are existentially upset that people like us in blue America look down on them? It seems to me most people aren't caring what the wider world thinks about them—they're buying their groceries... I don't believe they think about us."" John, you need to get out of the Upper West Side more often. They are absolutely thinking all the time about you, and your Columbia colleagues, and op-ed writers like me and you—even when you're intellectualizing their hatred of college campuses—and climate scientists and bureaucrats like Anthony Fauci (successful grandson of immigrants who once would have been lauded by conservatives) and of course lawyers like Alvin Bragg. Anyone who brandishes a diploma and tells them what they don't want to hear. Bonus points for anyone who tells them what they don't want to hear while Black, or while female. Their movement isn't defined by what they want but by whom they hate, and Donald Trump is the first politician who could articulate that rage with crude bluntness. I've spent a lot of time since the 2000s listening to people on the right—on my car radio, or at Tea Party gatherings and outside Trump rallies—and their message is pretty unambiguous. Their movement isn't defined by what they want but by whom they hate, and Donald Trump is the first politician who could articulate that rage with crude bluntness. McWhorter also said on HBO that Trump is ""charismatic,"" but he's not—not in the sense of JFK or the Gipper. It's only that he hates the right people, that he is the enemy of their enemy. For people fearful that whites or churchgoers are becoming a minority in America, or angry that cosmopolitan elites were redefining society as a rigged meritocracy where people without diplomas could be viewed as losers, Trump's hokey 2016 message that ""I am your voice"" resonated. But the perceived slights of the seven years since then—peaking in 2020 with the massive Black Lives Matter protests, the social controls needed to fight a pandemic, and Trump's Big Lie around his election defeat—have inspired 2023's much more dangerous message, that he is ""your retribution."" No wonder that Trump's looming potential indictments—by two Black big-city prosecutors that Fox News regularly blames for urban crime, and by the ""deep state"" of the U.S. Justice Department—are making him stronger by the day. No wonder his Waco throng stood with Trump in a sick musical celebration of the jailed thugs who attacked police officers in their Capitol Hill insurrection, Beer Hall Putsch martyrs for a new millennium. In an unreality zone called MSNBC, producers have reinvented the Trump saga as a political version of the O.J. Simpson trial—sometimes giving the whole hour to breathless coverage of the legal dramas for a shrinking audience in McWhorter's ""blue America."" Those viewers remain certain that Bragg or Jack Smith or Fani Willis will finally take down Trump despite seeing that the Access Hollywood tape and two impeachments and everything else did not. Here's what's real: American democracy has been in a doom loop ever since 2015. That's because the establishment keeps reaching into the traditional toolbox for the things—hard-hitting investigative reporting, congressional hearings, special prosecutors, and even impeachment—that always took down the bad guys of yesteryear, like Richard Nixon. The tools don't work on a movement based around hatred of journalists and prosecutors and even the FBI. Today, we stand on the banks of the Rubicon, and I would argue that the Alvin Braggs and Fani Willises and all of us treading water in a faith in democracy and the rule of law have no choice but to cross it. Prosecuting Donald Trump for both his high crimes and his misdemeanors is necessary to keep the republic—even if the consequence is some kind of ""Trump or Death"" civil war.

191,DeSantis,2023-03-28,"""Why We Must Defend Against the GOP Plan to Destroy Public Education""","The following are the prepared remarks by American Federation of Teachers president Randi Weingarten delivered on Tuesday, March 28, 2023 at the National Press Club. I. THE PROMISE AND PURPOSE OF PUBLIC EDUCATION Today, we once again grieve for families shattered by senseless gun violence. Please join me in a moment of silence for the lives lost at the Covenant School in Nashville, and for all victims of gun violence. Today we renew our call for commonsense gun safety legislation including a ban on assault weapons. This is an epidemic that our great nation must solve. There's a saying: You don't have to love everything about someone to love them. I'm sure my wife doesn't love everything about me, but she loves me. (I, on the other hand, love everything about her.) Nothing is perfect. Banks aren't. Congress isn't. And neither are our public schools—not even our most well-resourced and highest-performing schools. Those of us involved in public schools work hard to strengthen them to be the best they can be. But only public schools have as their mission providing opportunity for all students. And by virtually any measure—conversations, polls, studies and elections—parents and the public overwhelmingly like public schools, value them, need them, support them—and countless Americans love them. Public schools are more than physical structures. They are the manifestation of our civic values and ideals: The ideal that education is so important for individuals and for society that a free education must be available to all. That all young people should have opportunities to prepare for life, college, career and citizenship. That, in a pluralistic society such as the United States, people with different beliefs and backgrounds must learn to bridge differences. And that, as the founders believed, an educated citizenry is essential to protect our democracy from demagogues. Thomas Jefferson argued general education was necessary to ""enable every man to judge for himself what will secure or endanger his freedom."" Franklin D. Roosevelt said: ""The real safeguard of democracy … is education."" And Martin Luther King Jr., in accepting the United Federation of Teachers' John Dewey Award, made clear, ""Education is the road to equality and citizenship."" When kids go to school together, they become part of a community; their families become part of a community. That community comes together at school concerts, basketball games and science fairs, and for shelter and comfort, when people are displaced by natural disasters or, far too often, at vigils for victims of gun violence. In good times and bad, public schools are cornerstones of community, of our democracy, our economy and our nation. But some people want that cornerstone to crumble—and they're wielding the sledgehammers. II. ATTACKS ON PUBLIC EDUCATION AND DEMOCRACY Attacks on public education are not new. The difference today is that the attacks are intended to destroy it. To make it a battlefield, a political cudgel. After former President Trump lost re-election, Steve Bannon, his key ally, declared that their fight goes through school boards. In a speech last year, culture war operative and Governor Ron DeSantis' appointee Christopher Rufo put it bluntly, ""To get to universal school choice, you really need to operate from a premise of universal public school distrust."" To this end, he says, his side has ""to be ruthless and brutal."" And, I would add, well-funded, which it is. The DeVos, Bradley, Koch, Uihlein and Walton family foundations and others have poured many millions of dollars into anti-public education, pro-privatization groups like the American Federation for Children and EdChoice. The Betsy DeVos wing of the school privatization movement is methodically working its plan: Starve public schools of the funds they need to succeed. Criticize them for their shortcomings. Erode trust in public schools by stoking fear and division, including attempting to pit parents against teachers. Replace them with private, religious, online and home schools. All toward their end goal of destroying public education as we know it, atomizing and balkanizing education in America, bullying the most vulnerable among us and leaving the students with the greatest needs in public schools with the most meager resources. It's an extremist scheme by a very vocal minority of Americans. It's hurting our efforts to do the work we need to do, which is educating the nearly 50 million kids who attend America's public schools. And the urgent work of helping kids recover from learning loss, sadness, depression and other effects of the pandemic. And it's not what parents or the public want. Let's start with defunding: This year alone, 29 state legislatures are considering bills to either create or expand existing voucher programs.[i] This is on top of the 72 voucher and tax credit programs in 33 states already subsidizing private and home schooling, costing billions every year.[ii] Voucher programs are proliferating even though research shows that, on average, vouchers negatively affect achievement—the declines are worse than pandemic learning loss. In fact, vouchers have caused ""some of the largest academic drops ever measured in the research record."" Proponents of vouchers used to argue that they were a way for low-income and minority families to transfer out of low-performing schools. No longer. Today most vouchers go to families who already send their kids to private schools. And private schools are not required to follow most federal civil rights laws protecting students, so they can—and many do—discriminate, especially against LGBTQ students and students with special needs. The universal voucher program signed by Florida Gov. DeSantis yesterday will divert $4 billion from the state's public schools. Florida ranks 44th in the nation in per pupil spending, and 48th in average teacher salaries. DeSantis is sending taxpayers' dollars in the wrong direction. And then there are the culture wars. What started as fights over pandemic-era safety measures has morphed into fearmongering: False claims that elementary and secondary schools are teaching critical race theory; disgusting, unfounded claims that teachers are grooming and indoctrinating students; and pronouncements that public schools push a ""woke"" agenda, even though they can't or won't define what they mean. Banning books and bullying vulnerable children. School board meetings descending into screaming matches. This is an organized and dangerous effort to undermine public schools. Over the last three years, legislators in 45 states proposed hundreds of laws placing public schools at the center of culture wars: laws seeking to ban books from school libraries—even books about Ruby Bridges and Anne Frank and Roberto Clemente; laws restricting what teachers can teach and students can learn—particularly about about race, gender, LGBTQ issues, current events and American history; and laws attacking kids who are transgender. Students and staff should feel welcome, safe and respected in school—but the culture wars are fueling hostility and fear. A torrent of enacted and proposed legislation targeting even the mention of ""controversial"" topics—sweeping and open-ended restrictions on what can be taught—has teachers teaching on eggshells. In Florida, the Department of Education has threatened teachers and librarians with felony prosecution if they provide students with books that the state later decides are inappropriate.[iii] If Florida lawmakers have their way, colleges will no longer have diversity, equity or inclusion policies; or tenure; or academic freedom. And AP courses and the mere utterance of LGBTQIA+ will be banned in all K-12 schools. And forget about facts. Many laws and pending bills allow any individual to sue schools and teachers for perceived violations. The intent and effect are to create a climate of fear and intimidation. This takes a toll on the quality of education teachers can provide our students, and on the trust and connection that are so important. Shouldn't teachers be free to talk with students who are withdrawn or in distress, and to answer students' questions? Don't we want students to learn both our nation's achievements that make us proud and the failings that make us strive to do better? Isn't that our job? Teachers should have the freedom to teach. And students should have the freedom to learn. These same governors who are pushing vouchers and culture wars are also trying to defund and weaken teachers unions, so educators don't have the wherewithal to fight back against censorship, attacks on their academic freedom, threats to their livelihoods and criminal prosecution. These attacks aren't about protecting kids. If they were, they would be working with us to address learning loss and the youth mental health crisis. They would be working with us to take on social media companies for contributing to that crisis. If these attacks were about protecting kids, they would be working with us to fight against the leading cause of death for American children—gun violence. If this were about protecting kids, instead of putting LGBTQ youth at risk and banning books about Black people and by Black authors, they would give a damn about these kids' safety and well-being, including the youth suicide crisis. Forty-five percent of LGBTQ youth seriously considered suicide in the last year. And the suicide rate among Black youth of all sexual orientations has been increasing as well. This is literally a matter of life and death. These attacks on public education make it increasingly difficult to create the welcoming, safe environment that our students need and deserve. School climate and culture It is a fraught time in our country. The effects of COVID-19; the climate of conflict; drug abuse; gun violence; economic insecurity; and the youth mental health crisis have all taken a heavy toll. Hate crimes have surged against many Americans—Asian, Black, Latino, Jewish and Muslim Americans. School staff report a rise in bullying, verbal altercations and physical violence among students, as well as this behavior directed at them. I recall a teacher saying that when her students are disruptive, it's not because they are bad; it's because they're sad. So many students have experienced isolation and trauma. They need help. But there weren't enough mental health specialists before the pandemic, and they are in critically short supply now. The persistent demonization and disrespect of teachers—from screaming matches at school board meetings to the former secretary of state saying teachers teach ""filth""—have contributed to a culture of disrespect that seeps into our schools. I just got a report from Florida. In Flagler County, a 17-year-old student with special needs pushed a paraprofessional so hard she went airborne and was knocked unconscious. A teacher in Osceola County was monitoring students in the hallway when a student sucker-punched him. And there are others. The educators who were hurt all cited lack of staff in the schools and lack of mental health support for students as the main reasons leading to the attacks. And this crisis will only get worse as Gov. DeSantis' universal voucher bill kicks in. What will the loss of $4 billion do to safety in Florida's public schools? What will that do to the quality of academics, to the condition of school buildings, to teacher pay, to staffing shortages? III. CRISIS IN THE TEACHING PROFESSION Even before the pandemic, there were steep declines in teachers' satisfaction. The percent of teachers who were ""very satisfied"" fell from 62 percent in 2008 to just 12 percent in 2022. The stresses of the COVID-19 era—plus the culture wars, attacks on teachers, inadequate pay, poor teaching and learning conditions, and the threat of school shootings—have made recent years the toughest in modern times for educators. Despite it all, teachers have thrown themselves into the mission of helping students recover academically, socially and emotionally. You heard Tamara (Simpson). I witness these acts of teaching, of nation-building, every day. Yet, according to our critics, we're responsible for all the woes of society. Even before the pandemic, nearly 300,000 teachers were leaving the profession each year. Now, it's closer to 400,000. And the teacher pipeline has collapsed as college students and career-changers choose not to go into education. How are we going to recruit and retain the staff schools need in this climate? Our teaching profession is in crisis. It's in crisis because of the poor teaching and learning conditions created by inadequate funding for public schools. It's teacher pay, which has been falling relative to other college graduates' pay for the last 40 years. It's giving teachers all the blame and little authority. And it's the de-professionalization of teaching that demoralizes an already beleaguered profession. I hear it all the time—teachers just want to teach. IV. Strategies for Powerful Education So where do we go from here? The American Rescue Plan, and the programs it spawned, particularly the tutoring programs, have really helped. And we are grateful to President Joe Biden, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona and the last Congress for the much-needed resources. Of course we will continue to fight this defunding of our public schools and this dividing of our communities. But we also must do better to address the learning loss and disconnection we are seeing in our young people. And we can. We can make every public school a school where parents want to send their kids, educators want to work and all students thrive. Four strategies can help transform our schools to realize the promise and purpose of public education. Not just to overcome learning loss or get back to normal, but to truly help us prepare all children with the knowledge and skills they need for their lives, for college, for career and for citizenship. These strategies can help us create safe and welcoming environments and bring joy back to learning. And in tandem, they have a catalytic effect. I have seen it work. But we need to do these strategies at scale—for every child and in every school. These four strategies are expanding community schools, scaling experiential learning, addressing staff shortages, and deepening the partnerships between families and educators. Community Schools First and foremost, we need to make sure our kids are OK. That's why we need community schools, which are hubs for neighborhoods, combining academics with extended learning opportunities, family and community events, and an infusion of medical, mental health and other social services. They are the best system I know to connect students and families to the support they need to learn, live and thrive. A recent University of Calgary study found that youth suicide attempts increased 22 percent during the pandemic. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, nearly 1 in 3 teen girls seriously considered suicide in 2021—up nearly 60 percent from a decade ago. More than 42 percent of high school students reported persistent feelings of sadness or hopelessness. What helps? The Calgary report found that ""school connectedness, defined as feeling close to people at school, has a long-lasting, protective impact for adolescents well into adulthood."" Our schools must be equipped to support and connect with students, and there is no better model for this than community schools. There is another tragic reality in the United States: Half the students in America's public schools live in poverty. Community schools mitigate the effects of poverty by providing essential services right where students are and where families can be. Once kids' physical and emotional needs are met, they are ready to learn, and teachers can focus on their primary role—which is to teach. A few weeks ago I went back to Wolfe Street Academy, a community school in Baltimore, to see how they were doing. Ninety-six percent of the students there qualify for free- or reduced-price lunch. Since converting to a community school nearly 20 years ago, Wolfe Street has gone from the 77th-most successful elementary school in Baltimore (out of 80) to the second-most successful. And, like other community schools, when COVID-19 hit it was a matter of ramping up services, not having to start from scratch. Students have access to medical checkups, clothing and mental health services. Families have food assistance, language support and legal aid. And this school is fun! Wolfe Street offers a wide variety of after-school programs, including chess club, robotics club, Mexican folkloric dance, orchestra, a soccer league and more. And, by the way, Wolfe Street is a unionized public charter school. There are successful community schools in rural and suburban areas, as well. The Rome (New York) Teachers Association started a community school with help from the AFT in 2016. Today its Connected Model has spread to 14 school districts and provides everything from access to mental health services and dental care, to food packages for weekends and holidays, and prom dresses! A recent Rand Corp. study of community schools in New York City found positive impacts on both attendance and graduation rates. In New Mexico, community schools in operation for five or more years have better-than-average student achievement growth and higher attendance rates, and employed more highly effective teachers. And Robeson High School in Philadelphia went from nearly closing to a 95 percent graduation rate after implementing the community school model. AFT members have helped create 700 community schools across the country, and we see how they meet kids' needs. From Kimball Elementary School in Washington, D.C., to the Oyler School in Cincinnati, to Roybal-Allard Elementary in Los Angeles. That's why the AFT is calling for 25,000 community schools by 2025 and our call is gaining steam. California just approved another $45 million to make 1 in every 3 schools in the state a community school. And President Biden's budget doubles federal community school investment. We need to make this happen everywhere. Experiential Learning Second, we can re-engage students through experiential learning, transforming their educational experiences. Why do kids skip school, or slump in the back of the classroom? They may feel unsafe or unseen. Or just uninterested. We must do better. And we can. Of course, fundamental academic subjects are important. But so is how we teach them. Experiential learning engages students through problem-solving, critical-thinking, teamwork, and learning by doing. We need to help kids engage with the world, with ideas and with each other—not just with their devices. Experiential learning embeds the things that make kids want to be in school: The excitement of learning that is deeply engaging, and the joy of being together, especially after the isolation of the last few years. The camaraderie and responsibility of working together on a team. And in the age of AI and chatGPT, this type of learning is critical to being able to think and write, solve problems, apply knowledge and discern fact from fiction. Experiential learning can be applied to any content area from math to computer science to social studies, and often weaves subjects together in powerful interdisciplinary instruction. It can be adapted to any grade level. It can take place in rural, urban and suburban schools. And it nurtures kids' natural curiosity and creativity. That is what robotics and debate teachers do all the time. It's what I did as an AP government teacher at Clara Barton High School. These opportunities need to be the norm not the exception. This type of learning makes clear just how outmoded the standardized test-based accountability system is. Of course, the country needs data on how our kids are doing, but if we are talking about student success, research shows classroom grades, not tests, are the best predictor of that. And experiential learning takes the classroom to a new level. Experiential learning is assessed by teachers in their classrooms and focuses on mastery of the skill. It can include capstone projects that allow students to research a topic they're passionate about and present it to their teachers and peers. It can include nature-based pre-K, where youngsters learn by exploring natural surroundings while building social skills with other kids. It can include students working together to code and build robotics projects; service-learning projects to support community members; and summer learning on a farm caring for crops or animals; or reporting for and producing a neighborhood newsletter. And it can start with field trips, during and after school. Experiential learning has long been embedded in career and technical education programs where students use their minds and their hands to learn everything from auto repair, to nursing, IT, graphic design, welding, culinary skills and hospitality. CTE students learn skills that give them a head start when they go to college or start their careers. Shouldn't every student have that opportunity? It's also a proven strategy. Ninety-four percent of young people who concentrate in CTE graduate from high school, and 72 percent of them go on to college. Talk to any employer about the skills and knowledge they look for in a successful employee, be it a plumber, a nurse or a lawyer, and you're bound to hear similarities—employees who are creative, self-starters, critical-thinkers, problem-solvers; have empathy; and can build relationships. This type of learning provides every student with more options to develop those skills and to find their passion, their purpose and their pathway to good jobs and fulfilling careers. Carpentry students use math when they're figuring out the right cuts to make and how the pieces will all fit together. They're using their hands and their minds to construct something. They're acquiring literacy, technology and writing skills in developing business plans or a website. They're building self-confidence and public speaking skills when they explain plans and work with customers or their peers. They have a sense of pride in the finished product. When a project doesn't turn out as expected, they have to problem-solve what went wrong and try a new approach. On Governors Island in New York City, students attending the Harbor School pursue industry certification in specialties like marine science and oceanography. In Louisiana, the Teaching and Reaching initiative is a two-year dual enrollment program that gives high school juniors and seniors the opportunity to earn credits and get a head start on pursuing a degree in education. In Peoria, Ill., CTE programs are preparing students for green energy jobs. And the Rio Rancho, N.M., public schools partner with the local college to provide stackable microcredentials in robotics, coding and automotive technology. President Biden's remaking of the economy through the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and the climate provisions of the Inflation Reduction Act will create millions of new high-paying jobs in renewable energy, broadband, semiconductors, construction, cybersecurity, transportation, small business, entrepreneurship and so much more. Then there's healthcare and education, which have huge staffing crises right now. There are so many incredible opportunities for our young people in the job markets of today and tomorrow. They need to be ready to seize them. This dynamic new economic vision requires a dynamic new workforce vision. We are all in, but this requires more than educators. And doing this at scale will require new approaches. We need to start by high school. We need employers to partner with us, giving students internships and apprenticeships, including paid opportunities so students who need to work can afford to participate. That's why the AFT donated stipends for high school kids in Newark, N.J.'s Red Hawks Rising teacher pathway program. Teachers need experiential learning, too, and more externship opportunities in industry. The potential for all of this is in our grasp, but we all need to do better on the alignment of people, preparation and professions. And it means all of us making changes. That is why we are working with the AFL-CIO, Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Education Secretary Miguel Cardona, Acting Labor Secretary Julie Su, and the Bloomberg Philanthropies on this work. We are reaching out to business groups large and small, as experiential learning can take place in the private sector, the public sector and nonprofits. The formula of starting by high school and identifying school-to-career pathways, including community colleges, partnering with employers, and ensuring the opportunities are paid, can be replicated everywhere. Revive and Restore the Teaching Profession Third, for us to meet the needs of the 50 million children in our public schools, we need to revive and restore the teaching profession. That starts with addressing the teacher and school staff shortage crisis. And taking care of the educators we still have. We know how to solve this. At our 2022 convention, AFT members unanimously approved the report our Teacher and School Staff Shortage Task Force had been working on for seven months. That report is a blueprint with scalable solutions that every district and state in the nation can implement. But it boils down to treating educators like the professionals they are, with appropriate pay and time to prepare for classes, the chance to collaborate with colleagues, the opportunity to participate in meaningful professional development, and the authority to make day-to-day classroom decisions. And ensuring they have the conditions that help students learn like buildings in good repair, with safe ventilation and smaller class size. The Kansas City Federation of Teachers and School-Related Personnel recently negotiated a new contract, and they used the AFT staffing shortage report as their blueprint. Now, every first- and second-year teacher will be mentored by an exemplary teacher, who will be paid for serving as a mentor. The union secured the highest starting teacher salaries in the region and increases to keep teachers in the profession. They won paid family leave for any parent, making them the first district in the state having this essential family benefit. Where there's a will, there's a way. Thank you, Jason Roberts, the KCFT president, for being with us today. I'm really worried about the well-being of teachers and school staff. We are working with groups like Educators Thriving on strategies that address well-being. Their program has helped teachers reduce emotional exhaustion, a leading indicator of burnout. And as a union, we are providing a trauma benefit to all our members and have worked hard to reduce student debt and make the bipartisan Public Service Loan Forgiveness program work. That's been life-changing for those who qualify. But I am asking politicians to do their part as well. A word to politicians—rather than using educators as cannon fodder, why not work with us? Like New Mexico Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham, who enacted a $10,000 raise for teachers in that state. And Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who signed a bipartisan education budget that will make the highest state investment in Michigan history, investing in school infrastructure, teacher recruitment, school safety and mental health resources. And Sen. Bernie Sanders and Florida Rep. Frederica Wilson, whose bills would raise teacher salaries. And New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman, who has introduced a bill to reduce federally mandated standardized tests. Parents and Community as Partners Fourth, the pandemic proved what we always knew: In-person learning is essential for kids, and public schools are centers of their communities. It's beyond obvious that the school-family connection, the parent-teacher connection, is vital to children's success. But as others are trying to drive a wedge in that connection, we need to deepen it. PTAs are remarkable organizations; so are so many parent groups and parent-teacher groups like Red Wine and Blue, Parents Together, MomsRising and the Campaign for Our Shared Future. And we are honored to work with them and others. But we know we need to create this muscle of working together everywhere. That's why the AFT created the Powerful Partnerships Institute, which supports family and community engagement. In our inaugural year, the institute has given out 27 grants to AFT locals across the country. Montana is engaging thousands of public education-supporting families and educators across the state. New Haven is working with educators, families and students on fair school funding. And you just heard a little about our partnership in Houston. Let's be role models for how we deal with conflicts and disagreement. During the pandemic, we met via Zoom with parent groups that often disagreed with us on COVID-19 safety measures and school closures. We heard each other out and talked things through. We need more of that in America. Two years ago, the AFT increased our legal defense fund, so we could help if a member was put in jeopardy for teaching honest history or answering a student's question. But in too many places, there are no unions, or educational associations, or parent groups. People feel alone and isolated. Teachers. Parents. Children. That's why, in conjunction with the Campaign for Our Shared Future, we are launching a new Freedom to Teach and Learn hotline for teachers, parents or students to use if they need support. It's a place to call if you've been told to remove a book from the curriculum or from the library, or that there are topics that can't be discussed in your classes, or that you cannot teach honestly and appropriately, or if politicians in your district or state are targeting vulnerable student groups to score political points. The Freedom to Teach and Learn hotline number is 888-873-7227. These four strategies are worthy on their own. Together, they are transformative. Community schools will help young people not just recover from these punishing years and the scourge of poverty, but thrive. Experiential learning will prepare our youth with the knowledge and skills to seize the opportunities in our changing economy. To nurture and educate our young people, we need an educator workforce that is supported, respected and compensated befitting their vital role. And we need students' circle of care—family, educators and community members—to be united in their support. Conclusion This is our agenda. But this can't just be the work of our union or of school staff and schools alone. This is the work of a great nation—to ensure that our children's basic human needs are met so they are ready to learn to their full potential. To exchange outmoded and test-driven ways of teaching and learning for effective and engaging approaches that excite students and prepare them to live their dreams and aspirations. Our public schools shouldn't be pawns for politicians' ambitions. Or defunded and destroyed by ideologues. We are at a crossroads: Fear and division, or hope and opportunity.

The grand jury's move makes Trump the first ex-president to face criminal charges—and comes as the 76-year-old is seeking the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. An indictment or even conviction in the case would not prevent him from running. After other outlets also confirmed the historic vote, a spokesperson for District Attorney Alvin Bragg said that ""this evening we contacted Mr. Trump's attorney to coordinate his surrender to the Manhattan DA's office for his arraignment on a [New York] Supreme Court indictment, which remains under seal. Guidance will be provided when the arraignment date is selected."" Citing two unnamed sources familiar with the case, CNN reported that Trump faces over 30 counts related to business fraud. ""Donald Trump has spent his entire political career dodging accountability for his wanton disregard for the law. It is finally catching up to him."" In a phone call with ABC News producer John Santucci, Trump said this is an ""attack on our country"" and ""political persecution,"" adding that ""they are trying to impact an election."" The twice-impeached former president made similar remarks in a lengthy statement. Asked by Santucci asked if he will turn himself in, Trump responded, ""You take care, John,"" and hung up. Trump attorney Joe Tacopina told NBC News that his client is expected to surrender to the DA's office early next week. Trump supporters expressed outrage over the development—as did Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to also run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination but said Thursday that his state ""will not assist in an extradition request."" Despite warnings that this case ""is the first to result in an indictment, though arguably the toughest to win,"" as Mark Joseph Stern wrote for Slate, critics of Trump still welcomed the news as a long-awaited step toward accountability. \u201cDonald Trump was the most corrupt president in American history. He was the first president to be impeached twice, and now he\u2019s the first former president to be criminally indicted.\n\nTrump's corruption is finally catching up to him.\u201d — Citizens for Ethics (@Citizens for Ethics) 1680214108 ""We know of literally dozens of credible allegations of crimes committed by Donald Trump as president or running for it, with no charges filed. Until now,"" tweeted Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). ""We can't yet evaluate these charges, but make no mistake, this is a huge deal for accountability."" ""Donald Trump has spent his entire political career dodging accountability for his wanton disregard for the law. It is finally catching up to him,"" Bookbinder added. ""The charges in New York are the first ever brought against him, but they will not be the last."" Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) similarly said ""this is just one of many criminal acts for which Donald Trump is being investigated. Make no mistake: the fact that one of the most powerful people in the world was investigated impartially and indicted is testament to the fact that we still live in a nation of laws. And no one is above the law."" Daniels has alleged that she had an extramarital sexual affair with Trump, which he denies. Daniels' attorney, Clark Brewster, said that ""the indictment of Donald Trump is no cause for joy. The hard work and conscientiousness of the grand jurors must be respected. Now let truth and justice prevail. No one is above the law."" Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, who made a $130,000 payment to Daniels, said Thursday that ""accountability matters and I stand by my testimony and the evidence I have provided"" to the district attorney.

Urging secretaries of state and chief election officials across the country to ""do their job,"" Bonifaz said that ""the insurrectionist disqualification clause of the 14th Amendment makes clear that Trump is disqualified from holding any future public office based on his role in inciting and mobilizing the January 6th insurrection.""

There appeared to be little compassion from Moscow’s state media mouthpieces for the former U.S. president, who is widely considered a disappointment, having failed to deliver on everything Moscow had anticipated.At the same time, some Russian propagandists are still rooting for Trump, encouraged by recent statements that he was willing to allow Russia to absorb certain portions of Ukraine in the past, and in the future, he intends to stop military assistance to the country defending itself from Putin’s war of aggression.During Friday’s broadcast of 60 Minutes, an AI-generated image of Trump in court donning an orange outfit was broadcast while panelists excitedly discussed the spectacle his arrest would cause. On Sunday, host Vladimir Solovyov and the panelists of Sunday Evening With Vladimir Solovyov wondered out loud if the former U.S. president would be elected in 2024 and joked about Trump sitting in the Oval Office sporting orange coveralls and handcuffs.

314,DeSantis,2023-04-05,"""Private Planes and Luxury Yachts Aren’t Just Toys for the Ultrawealthy. They’re Also Huge Tax Breaks.""","by Paul Kiel ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. Flying to Ireland to inhale the seaside air as you drive a golf ball into the scenic distance. Crossing the country to reach your enormous yacht, which is ready for your Hudson River pleasure cruise. Hosting a governor’s wife on your very own aircraft. These are only a few of the joys that the richest Americans have experienced in recent years through their private jets. And what made them all the sweeter is that they came with a tax write-off. Over the past two years, ProPublica has documented the many ways that the ultrawealthy avoid taxes. The biggest or most daring maneuvers scale in the billions of dollars, and while the tax deductibility of private jets isn’t the most important feature of U.S. tax law, the fact that billionaires’ luxury rides come with millions in tax savings says a lot about how the system really works. There are dozens of examples of wealthy Americans taking these sorts of deductions, which are premised on the notion that the planes are used mainly for business, in the massive trove of tax records that have formed the basis for ProPublica’s “Secret IRS Files” series. The ultrawealthy, however, can easily blur business and pleasure. And when they purport to make their planes available for leasing, to fulfill one definition of using the planes for business, they tend to be more adept at generating tax deductions than revenue. Bryan Marsal (Agencja Fotograficzna Caro/Alamy Stock Photo) Tony Alvarez and Bryan Marsal built a successful consulting firm specializing in restructuring — advising struggling or bankrupt companies on what to sell and whom to lay off. It can be a grim business: Marsal has been known to announce to prone firms that they were now a “community of pain.” But the partners, who are also close friends, own another enterprise, the Hogs Head Golf Club (“Built by Friends, for Friends, for Fun”), on the southwest coast of Ireland. It boasts views of the nearby mountains and bay. In 2016, before opening their new course, the pair teamed up, via an LLC they named after their golf club, to buy a 2001 Gulfstream IV jet. The next year, President Donald Trump signed his big tax cut into law. It made buying a plane even more attractive: The full price of the plane could be deducted in the first year, a perk called “bonus depreciation.” Before, depreciation was typically only partially front-loaded, with the full balance spread over five years. The law also for the first time made pre-owned planes eligible for this treatment. As a result, when Alvarez and Marsal sprang for their second plane in 2018, this one a Gulfstream V, the entire cost was deductible. That year, the pair’s two planes netted them a tax deduction of $14 million. Tony Alvarez in 2008 (Brendan McDermid/Reuters/Alamy Stock Photo) Last August, their Gulfstream V took off from Westchester County Airport in New York state for Ireland. About an hour later, their Gulfstream IV left for the same destination, a small airport in County Kerry near their club. Both planes can comfortably seat over a dozen passengers, but flight records don’t show who was on board. Over the coming month and a half, the two planes crisscrossed the Atlantic several times. Were these business trips? Possibly, yes. (ProPublica’s records do not indicate whether specific trips were taken as deductions.) If so, operating expenses — including crew, fuel and other costs — from the partners’ trips to oversee the course would be fully deductible. These deductions would come in addition to depreciation. Michael Kosnitzky, co-chair of the private client and family office group at the law firm Pillsbury Winthrop, said his wealthy clients often own a business, such as an art gallery, in the same area where they own a vacation home. If the main purpose of a flight there is to attend to that business, jet owners must take care to make that as clear as possible. “I advise my clients to go to their secondary business location first” upon landing, he said, as a way to help build the case. Accounting for how a jet is used can get complicated. If nonbusiness guests, such as family, ride along on a business flight, it’s treated as a fringe benefit, which is taxable. (The benefit is typically attributed to the jet owner, experts said.) But that wrinkle isn’t too bad: The IRS formula used to calculate the benefit drastically undervalues the cost of riding on a private jet and is closer to the price of a first-class commercial ticket. Last Christmas, flight records show the two Gulfstreams again leaving together, this time to St. Vincent and the Grenadines in the Caribbean. While Alvarez and Marsal’s consulting firm boasts an office in the Cayman Islands, there isn’t one on these particular islands (which are about 1,400 miles from the Caymans), making it appear this was a family trip. Operating costs from “entertainment” flights like these are not deductible under tax law. But indulging in some pleasure doesn’t necessarily imperil the key tax prize of bonus depreciation: As long as, over the course of a year, the jet is used over 50% of the time for business, the owner gets to keep that perk. A spokesperson for Alvarez and Marsal’s firm did not respond to a request for comment. Mori Hosseini made his fortune as a Florida homebuilder and has owned a plane since at least 2006. When Trump’s tax bill began to gain momentum in Congress in the fall of 2017, he decided it was time for a new jet. The $19.5 million he paid for his nine-seat Bombardier Challenger 350 appeared as a deduction on his 2017 taxes, leading to almost $8 million in tax savings right off the bat. But there were more deductions to come. Even the interest on the loan he’d taken out to buy the plane was deductible, and his 2018 taxes show a $600,000 expense. Soon, Hosseini, a longtime Republican donor and close adviser to Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, was helping the governor and his family travel in style. In 2019, DeSantis’ wife, Casey, flew on the jet from Tallahassee to Jacksonville to attend a fundraiser held by a defense contractor. It was just one of several times that the DeSantises or the campaign have used the jet over the past few years, according to campaign finance records. Such flights are generally allowed under Florida law as long as they are disclosed as in-kind contributions. Hosseini did not respond to questions from ProPublica. The interior of a Bombardier Challenger 350 (Paulo Whitaker/Reuters/Alamy) On his taxes, Hosseini says the LLC that holds his plane is in the business of “aircraft leasing.” It’s a very common move among jet owners. When they are not using the plane, they rent out the plane for charter flights, usually via an independent leasing company. Not only does this defray the costs of ownership, but it has tax benefits, too. It helps them establish that they bought the aircraft for a business purpose, the business of chartering. In theory, taxpayers aren’t allowed to deduct losses from something that has no hope of being a profitable business. In practice, though, some billionaire-owned operations that look like expensive hobbies, such as racing horses in the Kentucky Derby, rack up business deductions by the tens of millions of dollars. ProPublica examined the tax records of over 30 wealthy Americans who owned planes, and one thing was very clear: Profits in the airplane chartering business for this set, judging from their taxes, were extremely rare. Hosseini's records show two years of profit over an eleven-year period. Or take George Argyros, a California billionaire real estate developer who once owned the Seattle Mariners. A major GOP donor, he also was the U.S. ambassador to Spain from 2001 to 2004. Argyros, 86, has leased out his aircraft through his own chartering company for decades. From 2002 through 2019, his tax records show, his company pulled a profit just twice. Overall, he deducted over $50 million in net losses over the years. In June 2021, Argyros’ Gulfstream landed at the small airport near Newburgh in New York’s Hudson Valley, having flown cross-country from California. Nearby, his $83 million, 248-foot yacht the Huntress awaited. Over the coming weeks, the ship would be seen cruising up and down the Hudson River, astounding locals who gawked at its six decks, helipad and hot tub. The Huntress on the Hudson River in July 2021 (Gary Hershorn/Getty Images) A representative for Argyros declined to comment. Yachts are dealt with differently from airplanes in tax law. They are considered entertainment facilities, so you can’t claim deductions on the premise that you used it for business travel. But that doesn’t mean there’s no tax savings to be had. Mike Fernandez is a capable businessman, having made a fortune starting and investing in health care companies. But the Florida-based investor seems to have abysmal luck with one of his businesses: leasing out his 180-foot yacht, the Lady Michelle, when he’s not using it. On his 2017 and 2018 tax returns, he claimed a total of $11.3 million in expenses connected with the Lady Michelle from depreciation, repairs, wages and other costs. Meanwhile, his revenue over the two years totaled $178,000. Fernandez did not respond to questions from ProPublica. Should the IRS audit one of these businesses — itself unlikely over the past decade, due to the gutting of the agency’s budget — the IRS faces a high hurdle: proving that not only was the business not profitable, but that the business owner was not really trying to profit. The case of personal jets adds an additional difficulty for an auditor. The ultrawealthy can often argue that, even if chartering did not result in profits, they also used the plane to help conduct their main business. Robert Bigelow made his fortune in real estate and owns Budget Suites of America, an extended-stay apartment chain. His passions, however, reach to the skies and beyond. For decades, he’s poured resources into investigating UFO sightings and paranormal phenomena. Two years ago, he announced $1 million in grants from his Bigelow Institute for Consciousness Studies for research “into contact and communication with post-mortem or discarnate consciousness.” Robert Bigelow (NG Images/Alamy Stock Photo) His main focus, however, has been space. He founded Bigelow Aerospace, a company focused on building expandable space habitats. The company has had some successes, winning a contract from NASA for a module for use on the International Space Station. But what it has not had is profits. Bigelow put more than $350 million into the company, “my own real black hole,” as he’s put it. In the two decades prior to 2018, even as Forbes and The Wall Street Journal variously estimated his net worth as $700 million and $900 million, Bigelow posted negative incomes on his taxes most years, as large losses from his aerospace company wiped out his other income. His personal jet, held by Cosmos Air LLC, also played a role. From 2005 to 2018, he deducted a total of $51 million related to use of his plane. ProPublica could not find evidence that Bigelow charters his aircraft, nor did Bigelow respond to ProPublica’s requests for comment. Of course, the deductions could also be justified on the basis that the aircraft is necessary to tend to Bigelow’s various businesses. The plane is a luxury expense, in other words, essential to help him run up millions more in tax deductions — one black hole orbiting another.

Ron DeSantis in the 2024 presidential election by attacking immigrants across the state. DeSantis, who is widely expected to run for president next year, is pushing the Republican-controlled state Legislature to pass Senate Bill 1718 and House Bill 1617, which would threaten Florida residents with criminal charges if they provide undocumented immigrants with shelter, work, or transportation and would require publicly funded schools and hospitals to participate in the GOP's anti-immigration crackdown. In a state where more than 1 in 5 residents are immigrants and the healthcare, tourism, and agricultural sectors rely heavily on employees who came to the U.S. from other countries, Florida Immigrant Coalition executive director Tessa Petit said last month the legislation ""has the potential to make felons out of every single Floridian."" ""From the soccer mom taking her children's friends to a game, to the clergy opening his place of worship to the children of God,"" said Petit. ""No one is exempt from this bill. The state is mandating who you can and cannot love, allow into your place of worship, business, or home; who you and your family can befriend, and how to interact with your neighbors, friends, and family who are immigrants in our state. It is time for Floridians to speak up and question the spineless puppet legislators who are supporting these inhumane and pointless divisive policies [and] destroying our Florida Way!""Under the bills, The New York Times reported Monday, Florida residents could be charged with a third-degree felony, punishable by up to five years in prison, for ""knowingly"" transporting, concealing, or harboring undocumented immigrants.There is nothing in the bill, said American Immigration Council (AIC) policy director Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, that would stop the state from prosecuting people who transport their undocumented family members in their vehicles or a bus driver who takes undocumented children to school. \u201cYep. Here are the elements of the crime:\n\n(1) transports, into or within Florida, a person who the defendant;\n(2) knows (or should have known); is \n(3) a person \u201cwho illegally entered the US \u2026 and has not been inspected by the Federal Government\u2026\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s it. No exceptions.\u201d — Aaron Reichlin-Melnick (@Aaron Reichlin-Melnick) 1681179513 As the Times reported, hospitals would also be required to ask patients their immigration status and report undocumented patients to the state; while immigrants could still ostensibly get care, critics say the policy would likely cause many to avoid medical care out of fear.The bills would invalidate undocumented immigrants' drivers licenses and prevent them from being admitted to the state bar, while DeSantis has also proposed eliminating in-state college tuition for undocumented students and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients.New penalties would be imposed for employers who hire immigrants without work authorization. Six percent of the state's workforce was made up of undocumented immigrants in 2016, the AIC reported, and immigrants make up 35% of healthcare support employees, 38% of construction workers, and 49% of farming, fishing, and forestry workers.""This is vile and disgusting, particularly in a state whose cultural vibrancy comes from waves of immigration,"" said Public Citizen president Robert Weissman.The state's ACLU chapter warned the legislation, which is expected to pass in the coming weeks, will ""quickly turn Florida into a vigilante, 'show me your papers' state"" where residents are afraid to help other community members for fear of criminal charges. \u201cThis could quickly turn Florida into a vigilante, ""show me your papers"" state whereby private citizens are demanding proof of immigration status from individuals prior to providing transportation in order to stay clear of the bill\u2019s penalties.\nhttps://t.co/VC8jLt1SEE\u201d — ACLU of Florida (@ACLU of Florida) 1681155350 Journalist Dan Froomkin suggested that with Republican voters nationwide showing support for increasing deportations of undocumented immigrants and ramping up border security measures and opposing policies to provide undocumented people with a pathway to citizenship, DeSantis is opening people across his state up to potential prosecution in service of his expected presidential campaign. ""This is not a 'crackdown,'"" said Froomkin.

367,DeSantis,2023-04-11,"""The United States Now Has a Fascist Political Party""","I hate to say this, but America no longer has two parties devoted to a democratic system of self-government. We have a Democratic Party, which — notwithstanding a few glaring counter-examples such as what the Democratic National Committee did to Bernie in 2016 — is still largely committed to democracy. And we have a Republican Party, which is careening at high-velocity toward authoritarianism. Okay, fascism.What occurred in Nashville last week is a frightening reminder of the fragility of American democracy when Republicans obtain supermajorities and no longer need to work with Democratic lawmakers.The two Tennessee Democrats expelled from the Tennessee House were not accused of criminal wrongdoing or even immoral conduct. Their putative offense was to protest Tennessee’s failure to enact stronger gun controls after a shooting at a Christian school in Nashville left three 9-year-old students and three adults dead. They were technically in violation of House rules, but the state legislature has never before imposed so severe a penalty for rules violations. In fact, over the past few years, a number of Tennessee legislators have kept their posts even after being charged with serious sexual misconduct. And the two who were expelled last week are Black people, while a third legislator who demonstrated in the same manner but was not expelled is white.***We are witnessing the logical culmination of win-at-any-cost Trump Republican politics — scorched-earth tactics used by Republicans to entrench their power, with no justification other than that they can. Democracy is about means. Under it, citizens don’t have to agree on ends (abortion, health care, guns, or whatever else we disagree about) as long as we agree on democratic means for handling our disagreements. But for Trump Republicans, the ends justify whatever means they choose —including expelling lawmakers, rigging elections through gerrymandering, refusing to raise the debt ceiling, and denying the outcome of a legitimate presidential election.My friends, the Republican Party is no longer committed to democracy. It is rapidly becoming the American fascist party. ***Wisconsin may soon offer an even more chilling example. While liberals celebrated the election on Tuesday of Janet Protasiewicz to the Wisconsin Supreme Court because she’ll tip the court against the state’s extreme gerrymandering (the most extreme in the nation) and its fierce laws against abortion (among the most stringent in America), something else occurred in Wisconsin on election day that may well negate Protasiewicz’s victory. Voters in Wisconsin’s 8th senatorial district decided (by a small margin) to send Republican Dan Knodl to the state Senate. This gives the Wisconsin Republican Party a supermajority — and with it, the power to remove key state officials, including judges, through impeachment. Several weeks ago, Knodl said he would “certainly consider” impeaching Protasiewicz. Although he was then talking about her role as a county judge, his interest in impeaching her presumably has increased now that she’s able to tip the state’s highest court.As in Tennessee, this could be done without any necessity for a public justification. Under Republican authoritarianism, power is its own justification. Recall that in 2018, after Wisconsin voters elected a Democratic governor and attorney general, the Republican legislature and the lame duck Republican governor responded by significantly cutting back the power of both offices. North Carolina is another state where a supermajority of GOP legislators has cut deeply into the power of the executive branch, after Democrats won those posts. The GOP now has veto-proof majorities in both of the state’s legislative chambers, which enable Republicans to enact conservative policies over the opposition of Gov. Roy Cooper, including even more extreme gerrymandered districts. Although North Carolina’s constitution bans mid-decade legislative redistricting absent a court order, Republicans just announced they plan to do it anyway.Meanwhile, a newly installed Republican supermajority in Florida has given Ron DeSantis unbridled control over the state — granting him total authority of the board governing Disney, the theme park giant he has fought over his anti-LGBTQ+ “don’t say gay” law; permission to fly migrants from anywhere in the U.S. to destinations of his own choosing, for political purposes, and then send the bill to Florida’s taxpayers; and unprecedented prosecutorial power in the form of his newly created, hand-picked office of election “integrity,” pursuing supposed cases of voter fraud.Florida has now effectively silenced even Florida residents from speaking out in opposition to Republican proposals. A new rule prohibits rallies at the state house. Those testifying against Republican bills are often allowed to speak for no more than 30 seconds.***Without two parties committed to democratic means to resolve differences in ends, the one remaining (small-d) democratic party is at a disadvantage in seeking ends it deems worthy. The inevitable result: Eventually it, too, sacrifices democratic means to its own ends. When a political party sacrifices democratic means to its own ends, partisanship turns to enmity, and political divisions morph into hatred. In warfare there are no principles, only wins and losses. One hundred sixty years ago, our system of self-government fell apart because Southern states refused to recognize the inherent equality of Black people. What occurred in Tennessee last week is a throwback to that shameful era.

370,DeSantis,2023-04-12,"""I'll Never Forget That Smiling Face of Ron DeSantis... As I Was Being Tortured at Guantanamo""","So many military staffers and guards passed through Guantanamo during my 14-year detention that I remember only the kindest, and the cruellest – the ones who seemed to take joy in our misery.In 2021, just as my memoir – Don’t Forget Us Here, Lost and Found at Guantanamo – was about to be published, I was on Twitter and saw a photo of a handsome man in a white navy uniform. It was Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida. I do not remember what the post was about – probably something about him clashing with President Joe Biden over COVID policies. But I remembered his face. It was a face I could never forget. I had seen that face for the first time in Guantanamo, in 2006 – one of the camp’s darkest years when the authorities started violently breaking hunger strikes and three of my brothers were found dead in their cages.After finding a Miami Herald article in which DeSantis bragged about his service at Guantanamo and confirming that my memory is correct, I sent his photo to a group chat of former detainees. Several replied that they too remembered his face from Guantanamo. Some said seeing his face again triggered painful memories of the trauma they suffered during their imprisonment. I understood. Even after spending the previous few years working on my memoir, which meant reliving everything I had been through at Guantanamo, seeing his face again triggered a lot of pain in me too.My advice to Americans: watch out. Do you want as president someone who tries to consolidate his power by creating an environment of fear? Someone who profits from the misery and pain of others?When I first saw DeSantis, I was on a hunger strike.In 2005, almost all prisoners in the camp started participating in a hunger strike to protest against torture, inhumane treatment, and being held indefinitely without even being charged with a crime. By 2006, news about our hunger strike was finally getting out. We were feeling hopeful.One day, as we continued our strike with the hope that change is just around the corner, a naval judge advocate general (JAG), whom I later learned to be DeSantis, walked the blocks with other new arrivals. He stopped and talked to us, explaining that his job was to ensure that the camp was abiding by the Geneva Conventions and that we were being treated humanely.I remember him asking why we were still on hunger strike. We told him to look around. Camp Delta was constructed from metal shipping containers, divided into cages with wire mesh. In the summer, the cages were like ovens. In the winter, they were cold and wet. They were loud with huge fans and the echoes of all the men’s voices. Then there was the persistent harassment by guards, desecration of Qurans, non-existent medical care, systematic torture, and being completely cut off from the outside world.We told DeSantis we were on hunger strike because we wanted to know why we were being imprisoned. Because we wanted a fair judicial process to prove our innocence. He took notes. He promised to register our complaints.A few days later, guards retrieved me from the cage I was in and took me to the recreation yard of the November Block. There, we were greeted by a group of nurses and corpsmen standing next to a metal restraint chair and several cases of liquid nutrient “Ensure”. A group of JAG officers and other observers, including Zak, the camp’s cultural adviser, were watching the scene through the yard’s chain link fence.I was informed that the US government was determined to break the hunger strike. The doctor in charge, a colonel, told me he did not care if I said I was innocent or protesting mistreatment. He was there for one thing: to make me eat. I refused and was immediately and violently strapped into the chair so tightly that I could not move. A nurse forced a thick tube into my nose and down my throat. My nose bled and the pain was so great that I thought my head would explode. The nurse would not stop. Instead, he began pouring Ensure into a feeder bag attached to the tube.“Eat!” the nurse yelled. “Eat!”They poured can after can in the feeder bag until my stomach and throat were so full that Ensure poured back out of my mouth and nose. I thought I was going to drown.“If you throw up,” a corpsman said, “we’ll start from the beginning with a new case and fill you up again.”As I tried to break free, I noticed DeSantis’s handsome face among the crowd at the other side of the chain link. He was watching me struggle. He was smiling and laughing with other officers as I screamed in pain.I threw up in their direction. They jumped back, disgusted. I did not care. I was the only one there who had the right to be disgusted.That force-feeding was inhumane. It was meant to break me and teach me a lesson. It was meant to show me that I was just an animal with no human rights. There is no other way to call it, it was torture.Because I had thrown up, they fed me another case. This time, they mixed laxatives into the bag. The mixture of Ensure and laxatives completely wrecked my intestines after having no solid foods for more than nine months. They left me restrained in that chair all night, soiled with my own waste and vomit.The next day they started again. The message was clear: they were not going to stop force-feeding me like that, torturing me, until I ended my hunger strike.So, I ended my hunger strike. All but a few of us did. A brother who saw me brought back to my cage said I was as swollen as a dead body found in the water.Still, we kept protesting, especially against guards desecrating the Quran. We started planning for another hunger strike. In June, three men on my block, Yassir, Mana’a, and Ali, were found hanging in their cages, their hands and feet tied, pieces of cloth shoved down their throats. The camp administration called the deaths “suicides” and “asymmetrical warfare”. No one believed it.I was eventually sent to solitary confinement, permitted to wear only shorts or a suicide smock – a heavy, disgusting-smelling tube of cloth too thick to roll into a noose. Along with the others in the solitary block, I was regularly pepper-sprayed, beaten during cell searches, and subjected to cavity searches worse than rape.I wrote about all this in my memoir. I did not mention DeSantis was there, witnessing the torture, because I did not know who he was when I was writing.As far as I know, DeSantis did not order my hunger strike to be violently broken or wrote the policies that allowed it to happen. He was just a guy who claimed he was there to help us and then just watched while we were being tortured. He did not torture me, but he sure seemed to take joy from it.Today, the violence my brothers and I endured in 2006, and its connection to DeSantis, are in the news again, not because the Florida governor belatedly decided to do the right thing and talk against it, but because he might run for president in 2024.In fact, DeSantis still calls Guantanamo a “terrorist detention facility”, even though back in 2006, the year he was there, an analysis of official documents found that the great majority of the Guantanamo prisoners were innocent men, imprisoned only because of mistaken identity or because they had been sold to the US for bounty money. Regardless of these facts, DeSantis advocated keeping Guantanamo open in his 2016 testimony before the Subcommittee on National Security, in which he claimed that all detainees were “hardened and unrepentant terrorist[s]”, whose release “risks harming America’s national security”.At the time of DeSantis’s speech, 80 prisoners remained at Guantanamo. I was one of them. Of the 779 men held at Guantanamo since it opened in 2002, only 12 have been charged with crimes. Only two have been convicted. I wonder who DeSantis was talking about. He was there. He saw who we were.I was born in Yemen. In my culture, a man is only as good as his word. DeSantis is clearly bending the truth to fit his preferred narrative. Maybe he is not a man worthy of leading Florida, let alone the United States.My advice to Americans: watch out. Do you want as president someone who tries to consolidate his power by creating an environment of fear? Someone who profits from the misery and pain of others? Someone who does not hesitate to bend to truth to further his political goals?Americans beware of DeSantis, and what belies his handsome smile.",Common Dreams,Business,Yes,23.81187917166924,89.5994904322907,90.7798945173696,45.08168936915117,92.29519498391022,78.80885244505595,smiling face,{},"{'staffers': 'military', 'man': 'worthy', 'policies': 'covid', 'time': 'first', 'years': 'few', 'detainees': 'former', 'memories': 'painful', 'treatment': 'inhumane', 'arrivals': 'new', 'fans': 'huge', 'harassment': 'persistent', 'care': 'medical', 'torture': 'systematic', 'world': 'outside', 'process': 'judicial', 'days': 'few', 'cases': 'several', 'observers': 'other', 'adviser': 'cultural', 'mistreatment': 'innocent', 'tube': 'thick', 'case': 'new', 'face': 'handsome', 'side': 'other', 'officers': 'other', 'rights': 'human', 'way': 'other', 'foods': 'solid', 'waste': 'own', 'day': 'next', 'body': 'dead', 'warfare': 'asymmetrical', 'confinement': 'solitary', 'shorts': 'only', 'block': 'solitary', 'thing': 'right', 'facility': 'terrorist', 'documents': 'official', 'majority': 'great', 'men': 'innocent', 'identity': 'mistaken', 'security”': 'national', 'narrative': 'preferred', 'goals?americans': 'political', 'smile': 'handsome'}",1,0

372,DeSantis,2023-04-12,"""Immigrant, LGBTQ+ Rights Groups Issue Travel Warnings for Florida""","Faced with persistent attacks from Florida Republicans, including presumed 2024 presidential candidate Gov. Ron DeSantis, immigrant and LGBTQ+ rights groups on Wednesday issued advisories for traveling to the southeastern U.S. state. The moves by the Florida Immigrant Coalition (FLIC) and Equality Florida follow the NAACP Florida State Conference voting unanimously last month to ask the national group's board of directors to issue a travel advisory for the Black community. FLIC's advisory—issued as a website—comes as DeSantis pressures the GOP-controlled state Legislature to pass measures that would threaten Florida residents with felony charges if they provide undocumented immigrants with shelter, transportation, or work while also requiring publicly funded schools and hospitals to participate in the crackdown. ""Travel to all areas of Florida should be done with extreme caution as it can be unsafe for people of color, individuals who speak with an accent, and international travelers,"" the website warns. ""Due to unconstitutional legislation supported by Gov. Ron DeSantis and introduced by legislative leadership, every county in Florida poses a heightened risk of harassment, possible detainment, and potential family separation based on racial profiling."" \u201c""The Florida Immigrant Coalition ... also issued a travel advisory today, urging reconsideration of travel to Florida and providing critical information about where immigrant travelers can learn more about their constitutional rights.""\n\nMore here: https://t.co/Qr4PcD3B1G\u201d — Gabe Ort\u00edz (@Gabe Ort\u00edz) 1681323640 The coalition's site also notes that ""naturalized and U.S. citizens of African, Latin American, Central American, Native American, Asian, and Pacific Islander descent are not immune from racial profiling, heightened scrutiny, and false arrest."" Additionally, as the site explains: Florida is poised to pass laws creating criminal penalties for medical providers who provide medically necessary care for transgender youth, weaponizing the courts to shred existing child custody agreements and reassign transgender youth to an unsupportive parent, and severely restricting access to prescribed medical care for transgender adults. Florida has passed or is poised to pass bills that restrict access to reproductive healthcare, including a near-total abortion ban, which threatens to force people to travel out of state or seek unsafe, illegal abortions. Equality Florida similarly pointed to the ""passage of laws that are hostile to the LGBTQ+ community, restrict access to reproductive healthcare, repeal gun safety laws and allow untrained, unpermitted carry, and foment racial prejudice"" when warning that the Sunshine State ""may not be a safe place to visit or take up residence.""Equality Florida executive Director Nadine Smith said in a statement that ""as an organization that has spent decades working to improve Florida's reputation as a welcoming and inclusive place to live, work, and visit, it is with great sadness that we must respond to those asking if it is safe to travel to Florida or remain in the state as the laws strip away basic rights and freedoms."" ""While losing conferences and top students who have written off Florida threatens lasting damage to our state, it is most heartbreaking to hear from parents who are selling their homes and moving because school censorship, book bans, and healthcare restrictions have made their home state less safe for their children,"" Smith continued. ""We understand everyone must weigh the risks and decide what is best for their safety, but whether you stay away, leave, or remain we ask that you join us in countering these relentless attacks,"" she added. ""Help reimagine and build a Florida that is truly safe for and open to all, and where freedom is a reality, not a hollow campaign slogan."" \u201cI never thought I would see the day where it is too dangerous to visit my home state and family. I had to spend an hour on the phone with my grandmother the other day explaining why I can't visit her this summer.\u201d — Alejandra Caraballo (@Alejandra Caraballo) 1681322092 Bryan Griffin, a spokesperson for DeSantis, told The Florida Times-Union that the new advisories were a ""political stunt"" and ""we aren't going to waste time worrying about political stunts but will continue doing what is right for Floridians.""DeSantis had responded similarly to the NAACP's move last month, saying, ""what a joke"" and ""I'm not wasting my time on your stunts."" The NAACP request came not only amid battles over various laws but also after DeSantis rejected the new Advanced Placement African-American Studies course for high school students. ""Our question to Gov. DeSantis is, 'What sort of future are you fostering for Black Americans throughout Florida while eradicating our historical contributions to this nation?'"" said NAACP Florida State Conference chair Adora Obi Nweze. ""There is no 'feel-good' version of the horrors and inequalities that Black Americans have faced or continue to face.""""Slavery, Jim Crow, and lynchings followed by ongoing school segregation, mass incarceration, police brutality, housing discrimination, healthcare disparities, and [the] wage gap are all tough truths to face,"" she argued. ""Misrepresenting the reality of our history promotes ignorance and apathy.""Although the request for an NAACP travel advisory was submitted as a resolution to the national board last month, review and approval of resolutions won't begin until May and are expected to go through July. However, board chairman Leon W. Russell has already weighed in, saying that ""the recommendation from our Florida State Conference is a clear indication of just how egregious Gov. DeSantis' actions are.""""Any attempt to intentionally erase or misrepresent Black history is a direct attack on the foundation of comprehensive education. Be clear—Black history is American history,"" Russell declared.

378,DeSantis,2023-04-13,"""Teach History. Democracy Requires It.""","At 85 years of age, having been a civil rights lawyer virtually all my professional life, at times my mind wanders toward despair. How as a nation have we fallen into such a place? How have we simply watched as one of our political parties has embraced election deniers who seek to undermine our democracy and mortally weaken our public schools and public universities? How have we watched abortion rights and voting rights come under the gun of right-wing political power? How is it that members of both our major political parties voted to let Congress and a Republican president weaken banking regulations designed to protect our citizens to the point where a major banking failure threatens us? How could President Biden authorize a massive drilling project for more oil in Alaska, which will only exacerbate the climate emergency?Teaching history is vital to the common good, not least because it’s a step toward encouraging political engagement at all levels.Certainly, there are many factors involved. There is the overwhelming desire for political power of some, which negates all else. There is the endless racism and belief by many in white superiority, which tears our country apart. And even for those of us who believe we think rationally and without prejudice, whether we do or not, there are old but continuing myths that divide us. On the conservative side, there is the myth that we are a nation of rugged individualists who pulled ourselves up by our bootstraps through hard work and self-reliance alone. These people believe that our problems are caused by a government that taxes their hard earned funds to support those who live on the dole.On the progressive side, there are too few that stray far from the center of the Democratic Party. Too many moderates believe in the myth of equal rights in the United States even as voting rights and women’s rights to control their own bodies are violated systemically. Many have rightly denounced the Supreme Court for its backward rulings, but still fail to see the court as anything other than a political body standing at the ready to destroy progressive dreams on many fronts. Meanwhile, the right-wing war on “wokeness” carries a serious threat to public education, the teaching of history, and our nation's understanding of racism in the United States. State legislatures and governors keep passing laws to limit what teachers can teach at the risk of criminal charges. So where do we go from here? Why not start with reclaiming that single word, ""woke""? That word, which originated in African American culture to mean “awakened to the injustices around you,” has been bastardized by right-wing politicians to mean virtually anything they don’t like. Today, extreme Republican politicians like Florida Governor Ron DeSantis have been weaponizing white fears of ""wokeness"" to criminalize basic teaching about slavery and other American history. Yet that teaching is vital to the public’s understanding of the true history of this country since the Civil War, when slave-like conditions were reestablished in the South, enforced by Jim Crow laws and the Klan. That teaching is vital to understanding that racism still exists all over America despite the passage of the 1960s Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts.Put simply, whites need to understand that clever spin doctors have turned ""wokeness"" into grounds for reducing, discarding, and sanitizing history. This is where we must fight back. Knowing our history means acknowledging our country’s many injustices. But it also means learning about the times when white people worked together with Black-led movements to pass the 1960s civil rights laws — and continue to do so today in spaces like the Poor People’s Campaign. That knowledge points the way to building a more just country today.Knowing this other history — of effective social movements — can help people to come together across races to address the wounds caused by police brutality, the school-to-prison pipeline, discrimination, and other injustices today. In short, history is a tool that can help people come together to work for a better America.

416,DeSantis,2023-04-14,"""NARAL Pro-Choice America Responds as Supreme Court Delays Decision On Mifepristone Access""","Late last night, anti-choice Governor Ron DeSantis signed an extreme ban on abortion in the middle of the night behind closed doors. The bill (SB 300) bans abortion at six weeks of pregnancy, which is before many people even know they are pregnant. Florida joins the growing list of states in the Southeast that have already enacted extreme bans, stripping millions of access to abortion in the region. Should this law go into effect, it would decimate access to abortion care in the Southeast. This ban comes as access across the country is under threat after a Trump-appointed judge ruled to block FDA approval of mifepristone, one of the two pills typically used to provide medication abortion care, and the case continues through the courts. NARAL Pro-Choice America President Mini Timmaraju released the following statement in response:“There is not a single state in the union where banning abortion is popular – not even in Florida. No one wants the bans extremists like Ron DeSantis are forcing on them and he knows it, which is why he signed this bill in the dead of night behind closed doors. We can only guess that he thinks this grotesque ban is a path to a presidential nomination – and it might be.

439,DeSantis,2023-04-16,"""Ron DeSantis: Yet Another Cog in Guantanamo’s Torture Machine""","Recently, there have been troubling revelations about Florida Governor Ron DeSantis — a leading 2024 GOP presidential aspirant — concerning his conduct as a Navy JAG officer at Guantanamo Bay. His responsibilities at the detention facility apparently included responding to claims of mistreatment from the war-on-terror prisoners there. Relatively few of these detainees had any connection with al Qaeda, and many had simply been handed over to US forces in exchange for bounty payments. But DeSantis seemingly viewed them all as wily and unrepentant terrorists.Of particular note, DeSantis was at Guantanamo in 2006 during the brutal forced-feeding of prisoners engaged in a mass hunger strike. Years later, DeSantis acknowledged that, as a legal advisor, he had suggested this intervention as a countermeasure to what he described as the detainees’ “waging jihad” — by refusing to eat. When interviewed last month, DeSantis emphasized that he “didn’t have authority to authorize anything” and that Guantanamo was “a professionally-run prison.” His first claim — sidestepping personal responsibility — may contain elements of truth; his second is outrageously absurd.As a general matter, the forced-feeding of mentally competent individuals violates international standards of medical ethics and constitutes inhuman and degrading treatment. This was especially so in the case of the Department of Defense, which opted to employ extreme, punitive measures — even described as torture by United Nations investigators — when force-feeding the prisoners at Guantanamo. These measures included a restraint chair that immobilized the detainee’s entire body for hours at a time, and the use of tubing that was inserted through the nose into the stomach and then removed and reinserted multiple times each day, often causing sharp pain and bleeding. A defense attorney for Guantanamo prisoners subjected to forced-feeding has written, “Only a sadist could impose and witness such treatment without grave concern and soul-sickness.” It’s hard to argue with that blunt assessment. But there are also two larger truths we shouldn’t overlook. First, even though DeSantis has disingenuously characterized the detainees as master manipulators who all claimed to be “Koran salesmen,” the hunger strikers were actually protesting an unconscionable system of indefinite detention and ruthless interrogation that relied on daily abuse — solitary confinement, physical beatings, sexual humiliation, and more. This routinized cruelty didn’t solely involve guards and interrogators. It also depended upon guidance from health professionals, who seemingly abandoned their fundamental “Do No Harm” principles to accommodate a White House insistent that the prisoners had no entitlement to humane treatment.These abusive conditions and techniques have left many Guantanamo prisoners —past and present — with deep psychic wounds. Survivors of torture often experience overwhelming feelings of shame, helplessness, and disconnection as a result of having been subjected to mistreatment at the hands of another human being. Frequently, the victims of such traumas are also haunted by depression, anxiety, and PTSD; by nightmares and flashbacks; and by a lasting sense that safety and solace will never be achieved. Viewed from this perspective, the hunger strikes that DeSantis witnessed — and apparently dismissed as terrorist tactics — are better understood as the prisoners’ desperate and despairing attempts to regain some semblance of control over their lives and circumstances, even at the risk of starvation.The second larger truth is this: accountability for Guantanamo’s horrors has never been a priority for our country’s elected leaders. No US president has ever taken meaningful steps on this front. George W. Bush, of course, never sought to discipline those responsible for the torturous policies his own administration authorized. Barrack Obama took action to end torture — but when it came to accountability, he decided “we need to look forward as opposed to looking backwards.” Donald Trump clearly had no interest in such matters, promising instead to bring back waterboarding and “a hell of a lot worse.” And although Joe Biden has expressed a desire to close Guantanamo, he’s now building a second, multi-million-dollar courtroom there for military commission prosecutions in which detainees have limited due process rights.So then how does Ron DeSantis’s alleged up-close-and-personal connections to prisoner abuse years ago really matter? It would be naïve to think that his political prospects will suffer. Indeed, he may even gain in popularity among voters who embrace his authoritarian mindset, share his disdain for protecting the rights of the vulnerable, and believe his misleading characterizations of the prison and the prisoners at Guantanamo.But the attention DeSantis’s story has brought to Guantanamo can still do some good. Ideally, it can spark broader public interest in an examination of the facility’s shameful 21-year history: how its detention and interrogation operations have dishonored the values this country has long professed to hold dear; how the prisoners there became defenseless victims of state vengeance run amok; how the perpetrators of torture and abuse — and their masters — have eluded any form of accountability; and how essential it is to close Guantanamo and throw away the key.",Common Dreams,Top,Yes,24.32463184588527,98.7925590599746,99.92041454564016,47.38254959572041,65.90689987979103,99.12314415974973,ron desantis,{},"{'revelations': 'troubling', 'aspirant': 'presidential', 'terrorists': 'wily', 'note': 'particular', 'feeding': 'forced', 'hunger': 'mass', 'advisor': 'legal', 'jihad': 'waging', 'month': 'last', 'prison': 'run', 'claim': 'first', 'responsibility': 'personal', 'matter': 'general', 'individuals': 'competent', 'standards': 'international', 'ethics': 'medical', 'treatment': 'humane', 'measures': 'punitive', 'body': 'entire', 'times': 'multiple', 'pain': 'sharp', 'concern': 'grave', 'truths': 'larger', 'system': 'unconscionable', 'detention': 'indefinite', 'interrogation': 'ruthless', 'abuse': 'daily', 'confinement': 'solitary', 'beatings': 'physical', 'humiliation': 'sexual', 'cruelty': 'routinized', 'principles': 'fundamental', 'conditions': 'abusive', 'prisoners': 'many', 'wounds': 'psychic', 'feelings': 'overwhelming', 'being': 'human', 'traumas': 'such', 'sense': 'lasting', 'tactics': 'terrorist', 'attempts': 'desperate', 'truth': 'larger', 'leaders': 'elected', 'steps': 'meaningful', 'policies': 'torturous', 'administration': 'own', 'matters': 'such', 'courtroom': '-', 'commission': 'military', 'process': 'due', 'connections': 'close', 'prospects': 'political', 'mindset': 'authoritarian', 'characterizations': 'misleading', 'interest': 'public', 'history': 'shameful', 'victims': 'defenseless'}",1,0

Those worries are misplacedOn Tuesday begins one of the most closely watched trials about press freedom in decades. Dominion, maker of voting machines, is suing Fox News for defaming the company during its coverage of the 2020 election. Fox hosts and plenty of more or less deranged guests had suggested that the election was stolen, spreading increasingly absurd theories about how the machines could flip votes from Trump to Biden.Quite a few observers, including liberals, are anxious that a victory for Dominion could backfire: if the case reaches the US supreme court, the latter’s radical right-wing majority, evidently willing to overturn precedents like Roe v Wade, could use the occasion to hollow out protections for news organizations (a category to which Fox evidently does not belong). Ron DeSantis is already busy tightening libel laws, explicitly targeting “legacy media.”. So, while Fox having to pay $1.6bn dollars to Dominion might be deeply satisfying for critics of a Republican party propaganda channel, democracy as a whole could turn out to be the loser.

541,DeSantis,2023-04-21,"""Fox's Settlement With Dominion Shows That 'Lies Have Consequences'""","When was the last time you forked over nearly $800 million? Really think. There must have been some moment, some dispute where you decided to reach deep within your checking account to find the better part of a billion dollars—a dispute where you weren't wrong, but you wanted to end things the easy way. Well, Fox News knows the feeling. While the United States braced to watch a sure-to-be-fascinating defamation trial between Rupert Murdoch's prized cable news channel and Dominion Voting Systems—which alleged that Fox had repeatedly aired false claims that it fixed the 2020 presidential race for Joe Biden—the two parties reached a settlement. The $787.5 million is about half of the $1.6 billion the election technology company demanded. ""Fox News' $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in U.S. history involving a media company."" Nevertheless, as CNN (4/18/23) reported, ""Fox News' $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in U.S. history involving a media company."" It amounts to 5.5% of total revenue of the Fox Corporation, Fox News' parent company, for all of 2022. It's still less than what Alex Jones of Infowars was forced to pay after a court found that he had repeatedly defamed the parents of the Sandy Hook shooting victims for faking the massacre (Independent, 9/15/22; AP, 10/12/22). And this wasn't Dominion's first settlement regarding false election claims: Newsmax, a network that's sort of like Fox News on crystal meth, settled a similar lawsuit with Dominion two years ago (Business Insider, 4/20/21). Fox's critics are disappointed; the network gets to keep its dirty laundry out of the light, and it still retains its place as the go-to right-wing cable news source (Atlantic, 4/19/23). On the other hand, Dominion attorney Justin Nelson (Deadline, 4/18/23) told reporters: ""The truth matters. Lies have consequences,"" and that the settlement ""represents vindication and accountability."" Tough legal road On the face of it, Fox had one big thing on its side going into the trial. The 1964 Supreme Court decision New York Times v. Sullivan holds that a plaintiff who's a public figure must show ""actual malice"" in order to prove libel, which means the defendant must have known that the defamatory statement was false, or else showed ""reckless disregard for the truth."" This is a tough standard to meet in court, and one that we've defended at FAIR (3/26/21, 2/25/22, 3/1/23, 3/10/23) against conservative calls to overturn the decision. But it does not seem to have been too tough for Dominion to meet. It appears that the Fox lawyers, taking a look at the jury, smelling the wooden air of the courtroom, and looking at all the discovery documents showing that Fox hosts knew what they were airing was bunk, said to themselves, ""We're not going to win this one."" They had good reason to be nervous. At the beginning of the trial, the network apologized to Judge Eric Davis, who is overseeing the case, after he said the network ""made misrepresentations to the court and delayed turning over evidence"" (ABC, 4/15/23). Fox News host Howard Kurtz tweeted (4/16/23): ""Judge knocks down some of [Fox's] key defenses, sanctions the network and suggests an investigation."" Observers forecast a tough legal road for Fox. The New York Times (4/6/23) said that ""a number of well-regarded First Amendment lawyers have called the Dominion case among the strongest they have ever seen,"" because the documents produced in discovery go far in establishing that people on virtually every level of the company knew that the allegations about Dominion were wrong yet for weeks did nothing to cut them off. LA Times legal affairs columnist Harry Litman (2/21/23) wrote that Dominion's case was ""unusually strong."" ""Defamation suits often concern the work of careless or sensationalist reporters slipping past fact-checking safeguards,"" he noted. However, the allegations in this case had threatened to ""lay bare a deliberate corporate decision to ignore the truth and publish lies."" At Bloomberg (3/18/23), Noah Feldman balanced the necessity of protecting press freedom and holding press outlets accountable, saying that courts should strive to ""preserve the core idea behind the law of libel: that no one, not even the media speaking about a public figure on a newsworthy topic, may knowingly repeat defamatory lies as statements of fact."" Feldman added that if we abandon that basic idea, we will launch public discourse into a fully fact-free zone. Donald Trump has already done his best to put us there. The courts and the Constitution should not give him an after-the-fact victory. In-house cheering squad And yet Murdoch's empire, as well as some other conservative journalists, had spoken publicly in the network's defense, seemingly convinced of Fox's blamelessness. William Barr, former attorney general under George H. W. Bush and Donald Trump, assured readers of the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal (3/23/23) that the case against Fox, before the trial, was weak, because ""it isn't defamatory for journalists to report on newsworthy allegations made by others, even when those allegations turn out to be false."" (In fact, reporters who repeat defamatory falsehoods are often committing libel, though there are exceptions to this general rule—Volokh Conspiracy, 11/7/18.) Washington Post media writer Erik Wemple noted that Fox even publicly scoffed at the lawsuit last year in its annual report (Twitter, 4/19/23). The idea that it's been proven that Fox aired false accusations ""is virtually gospel among American liberals,"" complained Glenn Greenwald (System Update, 3/3/23), a frequent guest on Fox's Tucker Carlson Tonight. ""As usual, these corporate media outlets""—as though Fox were somehow not corporate, or not a media outlet—""along with Democratic Party leaders, are marching in total lockstep, and none has aired any skepticism or questioning of this accusatory framework."" The Murdoch-owned New York Post editorial board (4/17/23) pulled an ""I know you are but what am I?"" routine in regards to the Dominion case, saying that the New York Times ran ""endless Russia, Russia, Russia stories"" about 2016 election interference (AP, 4/21/20), as well as the 1619 Project (8/14/19), which it called a Pulitzer-winning disinfo push hawking the factually inaccurate idea that the American Revolution was undertaken primarily to preserve the slaveholding rights of Southern colonies. There's some difference between allegations of defamation and a controversial interpretation of U.S. history. Who does the Post think should sue the Times for damages over the 1619 Project, the ghost of James Madison? The Post went on, ""How many internal emails from the Times' own newsroom would express private concerns over coverage, even as bogus stories are rushed into print to juice subscription revenues?"" That's actually a fair question, especially when you consider the Times' coverage of the lead-up to the Iraq War (FAIR.org, 3/22/23). However, that still doesn't vindicate Fox. No need to weaken press protection These defenses seem laughable now that Fox has decided to part with the equivalent of the gross domestic product of Samoa in order to keep its dirty laundry out of the public eye. Interestingly, though, Barr's defense of Fox got one thing right when he said, ""Conservatives shouldn't try to weaken the actual-malice standard""—which is something, as mentioned earlier, many conservatives want to do. In fact, some right-wing outlets are already warning the Florida Republican Gov.

550,DeSantis,2023-04-21,"""'Not Out of the Woods Yet': Supreme Court Maintains Abortion Pill Access—For Now""","In its first major abortion decision since reversing Roe v. Wade last year, the U.S. Supreme Court on Friday granted the Biden administration's request to continue allowing widespread access to the medication mifepristone while a legal battle plays out. ""This is very welcome news, but it's frightening to think that Americans came within hours of losing access to a medication that is used in most abortions in this country and has been used for decades by millions of people to safely end a pregnancy or treat a miscarriage,"" said Jennifer Dalven, director of the ACLU's Reproductive Freedom Project, in response to the order. ""Patients shouldn't have to monitor Twitter to see whether they can get the care they need."" ""Make no mistake, we aren't out of the woods by any means,"" Dalven stressed. ""This case, which should have been laughed out of court from the very start, will continue on. And as this baseless lawsuit shows, extremists will use every trick in the book to try to ban abortion nationwide."" \u201cWhile we\u2019re glad that access to mifepristone remains for now, judges should never have been deciding the fate of medication abortion.\n\nThis is not over, but we\u2019ll be fighting alongside you, every step of the way.\u201d — Planned Parenthood Action (@Planned Parenthood Action) 1682118141 Nancy Northup, president and CEO of the Center for Reproductive Rights, similarly declared that the decision ""is a huge relief, but we're not out of the woods yet.""""For now, providers and patients have the assurance that mifepristone is available"" and approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), Northup said. ""But we shouldn't even be here. This case should have been thrown out way before it got to the Supreme Court."" President Joe Biden also welcomed that the Supreme Court granted the emergency stay requested by the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) in Alliance for Hippocratic Medicine v. FDA, and vowed that his administration will ""continue this fight in the courts."" \u201cAs litigation continues, the Biden administration must use every legal means available to give drug manufacturers, distributors, health care providers, and patients the assurances they need to keep this medication available for the millions of women who rely on it.\u201d — Elizabeth Warren (@Elizabeth Warren) 1682118221 The high court's order halts a decision from Texas-based U.S. District Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump who earlier this month ruled against the FDA's 2000 approval of mifepristone, in response to a lawsuit brought by right-wing activists ultimately aiming to end abortion care nationwide. The 5th Circuit Court of Appeals then partially blocked Kacsmaryk's ruling, preserving access to mifepristone—which is often taken in tandem with misoprostol for medication abortions—but reinstating rules that it cannot be dispensed by mail and only can be used up to seven weeks of pregnancy rather than 10. Justice Samuel Alito temporarily put the 5th Circuit ruling on hold until Wednesday, then extended the deadline by two days. On Friday, he and fellow right-winger Justice Clarence Thomas dissented. While Thomas did not explain his position, Alito wrote in part that allowing the appeals court's decision to take effect while the broader legal fight continues ""would simply restore the circumstances that existed (and that the government defended) from 2000 to 2016 under three presidential administrations.""As Alio noted, oral arguments before a three-judge panel from the 5th Circuit are scheduled for mid-May—and, like arguments before Kacsmaryk in March, might feature right-wing attorneys trying to revive a 19th-century obscenity law known as the Comstock Act. \u201cThe disastrous decision to revive a nineteenth-century obscenity law to limit abortion access is something that, unfortunately, more abortion rights defenders should have seen coming. https://t.co/zANinaaA0d\u201d — The New Republic (@The New Republic) 1682084700 ""If it were just up to the science, this case would be thrown out,"" Dr. Daniel Grossman—an OB-GYN who directs the research program Advancing New Standards in Reproductive Health at the University of California, San Francisco—told The Washington Post earlier this month. ""We have over two decades of science showing how safe this is."" The Guttmacher Institute tweeted Friday morning: ""Remember, we should not be here in the first place. This case is about politics, not the law or facts. Mifepristone is safe, effective, and should be available to everyone seeking medication abortion care."" While some patients and providers already rely on only misoprostol for abortions, using it alone is less effective than pairing the two medications, so ""banning mifepristone could mean more money spent, more mental anguish over lingering symptoms of an unwanted pregnancy, and more time spent arranging treatment and figuring out how to step away from work or family responsibilities,"" Slate noted. ""For people who live in states that restrict abortion, it could mean a second trip across state lines."" ""It will also mean more pain and suffering,"" Slate warned, explaining that ""because it takes much more misoprostol to terminate a pregnancy without the assistance of mifepristone—three doses of four tablets, left to dissolve in the mouth, rather than a single dose of four—the physical toll can be harsher,"" with patients reporting ""a higher prevalence of diarrhea, fever, and chills."" \u201cThe Supreme Court just ruled that mifepristone will remain available pending appeal, but the fate of the safe and effective drug used in more than half of all U.S. abortions is still up in the air.\n\nLet's be clear: There's nothing ""pro-life"" about blocking access to medicine.\u201d — Robert Reich (@Robert Reich) 1682118596 The current legal battle over mifepristone comes as states controlled by anti-choice Republican legislators and governors continue to roll back abortion rights in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court's right-wing justices reversing Roe last June with their Alito-authored majority decision in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization. In a dozen states—Alabama, Arkansas, Idaho, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, Missouri, South Dakota, Tennessee, Texas, Oklahoma, and West Virginia—abortion ""is completely banned with very limited exceptions,"" according to the Guttmacher Institute's online tracker. Guttmacher characterizes policies in another 14 states as ""restrictive"" or ""very restrictive."" One of them is Florida, where Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis, a presumed 2024 presidential contender, last week signed a six-week abortion ban that will take effect if the state Supreme Court upholds an earlier 15-week ban. \u201cIf you are an abortion provider in Pennsylvania, know that your work has never been more important. My Administration has your back.\n\u00a0\nIf you are a patient in a state that's banned the care you need, our doors are open \u2014\u00a0and we will protect you and your provider.\u201d — Governor Josh Shapiro (@Governor Josh Shapiro) 1682117967 Stand Up America managing director for communications Monica Garcia on Friday tied the mifepristone fight to Dobbs, saying that the high court's decision ""to overturn Roe v. Wade opened the door for partisan hacks like Judge Kacsmaryk to attack abortion access in the first place.""""If Kascmaryk's ban is allowed to stand, it will have devastating consequences for millions of Americans who rely on mifepristone for abortion care,"" Garcia said. ""We cannot allow the right-wing justices on the court to continue to erode our fundamental freedoms until we no longer recognize the country we live in.

The suit came just minutes after a board appointed by DeSantis voted to nullify two agreements that Disney had quietly pushed through shortly before DeSantis’ takeover earlier this year. Those agreements allowed Disney to maintain sweeping control of the Reedy Creek Improvement District, a special tax jurisdiction containing its Orlando theme parks.

DeSantis, Files Lawsuit Alleging First Amendment Violation""","The Walt Disney Co. has filed a First Amendment lawsuit against Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, alleging a ""campaign of government retaliation"" for Disney's opposition to the ""Don't Say Gay"" legislation. This escalates the yearlong battle between DeSantis and Disney, as the governor's allies prepare further legislation to assert control over Disney's Orlando theme parks.Disney expressed regret that a resolution could not be reached with the governor and had to resort to legal action. The lawsuit states that Disney is fortunate to have the resources to take a stand against the state's retaliation, which smaller businesses and individuals may not be able to do. Disney asserts that in America, the government cannot punish individuals for speaking their mind.According to Wednesday's 77-page filing, Disney is alleging it has been the victim of a ""targeted campaign of government retaliation"" that has been ""orchestrated at every step by Governor DeSantis as punishment for Disney's protected speech,"" which threatens Disney's business operations. This comes after DeSantis' statement that he might consider building a prison near Walt Disney World property, adding to the growing tensions between the two parties.Disney's lawsuit reflects the severity of the conflict, asserting its First Amendment rights and opposition to alleged government retaliation. The outcome of this legal battle could have significant implications for both Disney and the state of Florida, as well as the broader conversation about free speech and government intervention in private business affairs.As the legal proceedings unfold, the ongoing conflict between the Walt Disney Company and Florida Governor Ron DeSantis continues to draw attention. The outcome of this lawsuit could have far-reaching implications, and observers will be closely watching as events unfold in court.Image credit: Getty/Roberto Machado Noa",Gamespot,Entertainment,Yes,23.20089983887385,99.05045964626648,99.1258599892328,42.34005950201479,85.77136214442113,81.04108898971441,disney battle,{},"{'battle': 'legal', 'legislation': 'further', 'action': 'legal', 'businesses': 'smaller', 'campaign': 'targeted', 'speech': 'free', 'tensions': 'growing', 'retaliation': 'alleged', 'implications': 'reaching', 'conversation': 'broader', 'affairs': 'private', 'proceedings': 'legal', 'conflict': 'ongoing'}",1,1

Ron DeSantis on Thursday scolded a journalist for asking him about his time working as a naval judge advocate general at the U.S. penal colony in Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. During an event at Israel's Museum of Tolerance, DeSantis was asked about allegations that he was present on at least one occasion when a former Guantánamo detainee was force-fed by guards to quash a hunger strike. The United Nations has deemed force-feeding a form of torture. Before the reporter could finish his question, DeSantis, who is believed to be preparing a bid for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination, snapped, ""No, no... all that's BS, totally BS."" After the journalist completed his question, DeSantis angrily responded: ""Who said that? How would they know me? Okay, think about that. Do you honestly believe that's credible?... This is 2006, I'm a junior officer, do you honestly think that they would have remembered me from Adam? Of course not!"" In response, Mansoor Adayfi, a Yemeni citizen who was incarcerated without charges at Guantánamo for 14 years, tweeted, ""I will never forget his face, he was laughing and smiling watching me being tortured on the force-feeding chair."" \u201c@MikePrysner Yes, Mike. I will never forget his face, he was laughing and smiling watching me being tortured on the force feeding chair. \n\nhttps://t.co/sVZGk9k108\u201d — Mike Prysner (@Mike Prysner) 1682627436 While chastising the reporter, DeSantis, who is trying to crack down on press freedom in Florida, accused Adayfi of ""trying to get into the news because they know people like you will consume it because it fits your preordained narrative that you're trying to spin."" ""Focus on the facts and stop worrying about the narrative,"" DeSantis said. Adayfi, who was finally released from Guantánamo in 2016 without ever being charged with a crime, first told Mike Prysner's Eyes Left podcast in November that guards brutally force-fed him and other prisoners cans of Ensure in 2006 to break a hunger strike and that DeSantis was there for at least one torture session. ""Ron DeSantis was there watching us. We were crying, screaming,"" said Adayfi. ""We were tied to the feeding chair. And that guy was watching that. He was laughing."" Unable to handle the amount of Ensure being crammed into his body through his nostrils, ""I threw up on his face,"" Adayfi said. ""Literally. On his face."" ""When I was screaming, I look at him [Ron DeSantis] and he was actually smiling. Like someone who enjoyed it,"" Adayfi added. ""It shocked us all."" In March, Adayfi told The Independent that he doesn't ""remember exactly when DeSantis came because we had no watch, no calendar, nothing."" According to Adayfi, DeSantis feigned concern for the detainees' welfare before watching them endure torture: ""He came to talk to us along [with] others—medical staff and interpreters. And we explained to him why we were on hunger strike. And he told us, 'I'm here to ensure that you get treated humanely and properly.' We were talking about our problems with the brothers, the torture, the abuses, the no healthcare."" An investigation by The Independent confirmed that DeSantis' role as an attorney at Guantánamo was to field complaints of illegal treatment. A second former prisoner has claimed the Florida governor witnessed forced feeding. Following his stint at Guantánamo, DeSantis advocated for its continued operation and against the release of detainees. In an Al Jazeera opinion piece published earlier this month, Adayfi explained how he came to recognize DeSantis:In 2021, just as my memoir—Don't Forget Us Here, Lost and Found at Guantánamo—was about to be published, I was on Twitter and saw a photo of a handsome man in a white navy uniform. It was Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida. I do not remember what the post was about—probably something about him clashing with President Joe Biden over Covid policies. But I remembered his face. It was a face I could never forget. I had seen that face for the first time in Guantánamo, in 2006—one of the camp's darkest years when the authorities started violently breaking hunger strikes and three of my brothers were found dead in their cages.After finding a Miami Herald article in which DeSantis bragged about his service at Guantánamo and confirming that my memory is correct, I sent his photo to a group chat of former detainees. Several replied that they too remembered his face from Guantánamo. Some said seeing his face again triggered painful memories of the trauma they suffered during their imprisonment. I understood. Even after spending the previous few years working on my memoir, which meant reliving everything I had been through at Guantánamo, seeing his face again triggered a lot of pain in me too.As Adayfi pointed out, ""DeSantis still calls Guantánamo a 'terrorist detention facility,' even though back in 2006, the year he was there, an analysis of official documents found that the great majority of the Guantánamo prisoners were innocent men, imprisoned only because of mistaken identity or because they had been sold to the U.S. for bounty money."" ""Regardless of these facts, DeSantis advocated keeping Guantánamo open in his 2016 testimony before the Subcommittee on National Security, in which he claimed that all detainees were 'hardened and unrepentant terrorist[s],' whose release 'risks harming America's national security,'"" Adayfi wrote. ""At the time of DeSantis' speech, 80 prisoners remained at Guantánamo. I was one of them,"" he continued. ""Of the 779 men held at Guantánamo since it opened in 2002, only 12 have been charged with crimes. Only two have been convicted. I wonder who DeSantis was talking about.""Adayfi, who was just 18 years old when he was sent to Guantánamo in 2002, is one of several people released in recent years.

The Florida House of Representatives passed S.B. 7050 by a 76-34 party-line vote after the state Senate approved the measure—which DeSantis is expected to sign into law—earlier this week.S.B. 7050 would boost the power of Florida's Office of Election Crimes and Security to review and conduct preliminary investigations into ""any alleged election irregularity"" and ""make referrals for further legal action."" Under the proposal, voter registration groups could be fined up to $250,000 per year—penalties are currently capped at $50,000— for failing to submit completed registration applications to officials within 10 days.""We can't disregard, given recent history, that the Legislature's unspoken intent, once again, is to impose barriers and confuse voters,"" the Miami Herald's editorial board wrote in response to the legislation. \u201cMultiple voting rights organizations have opposed the bill, arguing that these measures will \u201cmake it harder for Floridians to register and vote, and undermine Florida\u2019s election administration.""\u201d — Black Voters Matter Fund (@Black Voters Matter Fund) 1682547588 An amendment to the bill allows Florida's governor to run for federal office without having to resign, a measure largely seen as opening the door for DeSantis to run for president.In a letter sent Tuesday to Florida legislative leaders, officials from dozens of civil and voting rights groups warned that S.B. 7050 would ""make it harder for Floridians to register and vote, and undermine Florida's election administration."" Mary Kay Rosinski, co-president of the League of Women Voters Villages/Tri-County, noted that the bill would: Create more barriers to conducting voter registration drives; Establish steeper fines for volunteer, community-based registration groups; Add more restrictions on mail-in ballots; Give the Office of Election Crimes and Security expanded authority to investigate and prosecute alleged election violations; and Remove the government's liability for issuing voter registration cards to returning citizens whose voting rights have not been restored.

The truth is that core First Amendment principles of viewpoint and content neutrality—which mean the government may never restrict speech simply because officials disagree with or disapprove of a particular opinion, idea, or topic—have been essential for unconvinced progressives like MacKinnon to speak, read, perform, teach, and protest in states where majorities are hostile to progressive ideas.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,No,23.311487499013488,66.9295309366662,23.29162004403737,42.83629630692991,45.40714613341601,37.86650607033595,first amendment,{},"{'scholar': 'legal', 'century': 'last', 'traction': 'increasing', 'age': 'digital', 'media': 'social', 'tribalism': 'political', 'voices': 'extreme', 'arguments': 'similar', 'outlets': 'elite', 'picture': 'different', 'narratives': 'breathless', 'speech': 'free', 'opinion': 'particular', 'progressives': 'unconvinced', 'ideas': 'progressive'}",1,1

660,DeSantis,2023-04-29,"""Why Are Republican Leaders Eagerly Embracing Transphobia?""","For a second week, Montana Republicans have blocked Democratic transgender lawmaker Zooey Zephyr from participating in a debate over proposed restrictions on transgender youth. Zephyr, a first-term Democrat from Missoula and the first openly transgender woman elected to the Montana legislature, hasn't been allowed to speak on the state house floor since last Tuesday, when she told Republican colleagues they would have ""blood on their hands"" if they banned gender-affirming medical care for transgender youth. On Monday, her supporters brought the House session to a halt, chanting, ""Let her speak!"" from the gallery before being escorted out. Seven were arrested for criminal trespass. Republican leaders describe the disruption as an ""insurrection."" Bigotry against minority groups based on sexual orientation or gender Identity, such as the trans community, is a way fascism takes root. Also this week, at least two Bud Light marketing executives have been put on leave after transgender influencer Dylan Mulvaney posted a video of herself on Instagram holding a custom Bud Light can with her face on it. The company had sent it to her to help celebrate a year since she began her transition and had sponsored Mulvaney's Instagram post. Her post prompted a Star Wars cantina—Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, and Fox News hosts all calling for a boycott of Bud Light. Kid Rock posted a video of himself shooting 12-packs with a submachine gun, and others filmed themselves destroying and dumping out cans. Anheuser-Busch facilities have received bomb threats. Sales of Bud Light fell 17% in the week ending April 15 compared to the same week in 2022. Some bars are halting its sales. *** It's tempting to dismiss all this as just another outcropping of crazy right-wing bigotry. And it's tempting to be appalled at such blatant prejudice but believe there must be more important issues to worry about. According to the Pew Research Center, only 1.6% of U.S. adults are transgender or nonbinary (that is, their gender differs from the sex they were assigned at birth). Yet let me remind you: Bigotry against minority groups based on sexual orientation or gender Identity, such as the trans community, is a way fascism takes root. As the world tragically witnessed in Europe in the 1920s and 1930s, the politics of sexual anxiety gains traction when traditional male gender roles of family provider and protector are hit by economic insecurity. Fascist politics distorts and expands this male anxiety into fear that one's family is under existential threat from LGBTQ+ people who reject the family's traditional structure and traditions. As philosopher Jason Stanley notes in his How Fascism Works (2018): Men, already made anxious by a perceived loss of status resulting from increasing gender equality can easily be thrust into panic by demagoguery directed against sexual minorities… . The fascist leader is analogous to the patriarchal father, the ""CEO"" of the traditional family… . Attacking trans women, and representing the feared other as a threat to the manhood of the nation, are ways of placing the very idea of manhood at the center of political attention, gradually introducing fascist ideals of hierarchy and domination by physical power to the public sphere. I don't mean to suggest that the imbibers of Bud Light or the Republican lawmakers of Montana are necessarily fearful for their manhood. But they may lean more toward hierarchy and domination than the typical American (Montana Governor Greg Gianforte famously punched a reporter who asked him a question about a Republican health-care bill). Notably, Republican lawmakers now eagerly enacting restrictions on transgender youth across the nation have not moved to alleviate economic anxieties at the root of much of this. Why not? Because those anxieties fuel the anger that animates these politicians' most ardent supporters. Scapegoating a minority group based on sexual orientation or gender identity gives these supporters even more fuel. A similar blind anger found expression in the attack on the U.S. Capitol on January 6, 2021—which was a genuine insurrection, unlike this week's chants in Montana's legislature. A similar anger propels Trumpism to this day. If the rest of us want to stop America's slouch toward fascism, we must do two things: First, speak out loudly and forcefully against sexual bigotry. Second, push lawmakers to restore some degree of economic security to the nation's large and increasingly precarious working class.",Common Dreams,Top,Yes,23.311487499013488,98.24935214374412,99.99091201615128,42.83629630692991,45.40714613341601,37.86650607033595,leaders eagerly,{},"{'week': 'same', 'lawmaker': 'democratic', 'restrictions': 'proposed', 'term': 'first', 'woman': 'first', 'colleagues': 'republican', 'care': 'medical', 'youth': 'transgender', 'trespass': 'criminal', 'leaders': 'republican', 'orientation': 'sexual', 'bigotry': 'sexual', 'wing': 'right', 'prejudice': 'blatant', 'issues': 'important', 'anxiety': 'male', 'roles': 'male', 'insecurity': 'economic', 'politics': 'fascist', 'threat': 'existential', 'structure': 'traditional', 'loss': 'perceived', 'equality': 'increasing', 'minorities': 'sexual', 'leader': 'fascist', 'father': 'patriarchal', 'family': 'traditional', 'women': 'trans', 'idea': 'very', 'attention': 'political', 'ideals': 'fascist', 'power': 'physical', 'sphere': 'public', 'lawmakers': 'republican', 'bill': 'republican', 'anxieties': 'economic', 'supporters': 'ardent', 'fuel': 'more', 'anger': 'blind', 'insurrection': 'genuine', 'propels': 'similar', 'security': 'economic', 'class': 'working'}",1,1

Ron DeSantis to take the unlikely step of vetoing the measure. S.B. 266 would require Florida's Board of Education and its state university system's board of governors to establish faculty committees tasked with reviewing and, if deemed necessary, rejecting or adjusting all general education courses. Under the bill, these courses ""may not distort significant historical events or include a curriculum that teaches identity politics… or is based on theories that systemic racism, sexism, oppression, and privilege are inherent in the institutions of the United States and were created to maintain social, political, and economic inequities."" The Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) said that ""this provision is flatly unconstitutional."" ""Bans on ideas in the collegiate setting are unconstitutional, illiberal, and shortsighted,"" the group argued. ""Prohibiting ideas in the name of freedom is not freedom at all. It is censorship."" \u201cWe do not increase freedom of speech by eliminating someone's speech. \n\nBottom line.\n\nHere\u2019s my close on an amendment trying to ensure faculty speech is protected via HB999/SB266.

Eskamani \ud83d\udd28) 1683078612 S.B. 266 also prohibits universities and colleges from funding activities, speakers, events, and clubs that promote diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). According to The Chronicle of Higher Education, Florida is one of 20 states where bills targeting DEI on college campuses have been introduced. Last week, Republican North Dakota Gov. Doug Burgum signed the nation's first law prohibiting colleges from mandating DEI training. In Florida, critics compared S.B. 266 to the Stop WOKE Act, a censorship law signed by DeSantis last year limiting how state university professors teach race, gender, and U.S. history. The legislation is widely viewed by progressives as part of the GOP-led war on critical race theory, a graduate-level academic framework for understanding systemic racism in the United States. In March, a federal appeals court upheld a preliminary injunction against the law. ""Just as it was positively dystopian with the Stop WOKE Act, it remains unconscionable that the state Legislature has spent this much time and energy trying to prevent students and faculty from engaging in conversations with which legislators personally disagree,"" ACLU of Florida staff attorney Jerry Edwards said in a statement. ""Instead of engaging in meaningful policymaking to improve Floridians' lives, lawmakers have conjured a boogeyman out of thin air to expand the government's reach in all corners of our state,"" Edwards added. ""Free speech does not end at the classroom door. The attack on free speech in education must end here. Gov.

It serves only to undermine progress toward racial justice and must not be allowed to go into effect."" ""This attack on DEI will remove important support for students of color, erase their heritage from campuses and classrooms, and ultimately lead to increased racial bias,"" Watson added. NAACP Legal Defense Fund senior counsel Charles McLaurin warned that ""if enacted, the S.B. 266 bill in Florida will threaten the quality of higher education inside and outside the classroom.""""All educators and students are entitled to participate and contribute to a fair and high-quality educational experience that is grounded in basic values of accuracy, equity, and truth,"" he added.Also on Wednesday, the Florida Senate voted to expand the state's so-called ""Don't Say Gay or Trans"" law—a ban on ""classroom instruction on sexual orientation or gender identity""—through eighth grade. The original law signed by DeSantis last year was applicable in grades K-3. \u201cDon't Say Gay 2.0 has been filed.

A trio of ACLU policy experts sent a letter to the committee about three bills: the Cooper Davis Act, the Eliminating Abusive and Rampant Neglect of Interactive Technologies (EARN IT) Act, and the Strengthening Transparency and Obligation to Protect Children Suffering from Abuse and Mistreatment (STOP CSAM) Act. ""These bills purport to hold powerful companies accountable for their failure to protect children and other vulnerable communities from dangers on their services when, in reality, increasing censorship and weakening encryption would not only be ineffective at solving these concerns, it would in fact exacerbate them,"" said one of the experts, ACLU senior policy counsel Cody Venzke. \u201cThe EARN IT Act claims to make the Internet safer for children, but instead invites constant government surveillance.\n\nThis is a big threat to our privacy and our right to free speech online \u2014 we can't let it pass.https://t.co/vETVy5jZGC\u201d — ACLU (@ACLU) 1683223921 Named for a Kansas teenager who died after taking a pill laced with fentanyl, the Cooper Davis Act (S. 1080) would require social media companies and other communication service providers to give federal agencies information about illicit activity related to the synthetic opioid on their platforms. The EARN IT Act (S. 1207)—which targets Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act—would remove tech companies' blanket liability protection for civil or criminal law violations related to online child sexual abuse material and establish a national commission to craft voluntary ""best practices"" for providers. Sponsored by committee Chair Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), the STOP CSAM Act (S. 1199) would, among other provisions, enable survivors of online child sexual exploitation to bring a civil cause of action against tech companies that promoted or facilitated the abuse. The ACLU warns that the proposals ""would undermine free speech, privacy, and security."" As the letter explains: First, they incentivize platforms to monitor and censor their users' speech and interfere with content moderation decisions. Second, they disincentivize platforms from providing end-to-end encrypted communications services, exposing the public to abusive commercial and government surveillance practices and as a result, dissuading people from communicating with each other electronically about everything from healthcare decisions to business transactions. And third, they expand warrantless government access to private data. As longtime champions of privacy, free speech, and an open internet, we strongly urge you to vote against reporting these bills out of committee. Despite the ACLU's argument that ""there are other avenues to protect children, privacy, and safety online that do not lead to increased surveillance, censorship, and policing,"" the committee on Thursday unanimously advanced the EARN IT Act, spearheaded by Ranking Member Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.). As Common Dreams reported Tuesday, the Center for Democracy & Technology led 132 other groups—including the ACLU—in a letter to the panel which says: ""We support curbing the scourge of child exploitation online. However, EARN IT will instead make it harder for law enforcement to protect children. It will also result in online censorship that will disproportionately impact marginalized communities."" Fight for the Future, another signatory to that letter, tweeted Thursday that ""the dangerous, anti-encryption #EARNITAct passed out of committee this morning. We know this bill—it's back from the dead to restrict the internet and make everyone less safe online."" The group also thanked Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) for entering the coalition's letter about the EARN IT Act into the record. Representatives from the ACLU, Electronic Frontier Foundation, Equality Arizona, Fight for the Future, Reframe Health and Justice, and Woodhull Freedom Foundation came together with grassroots organizer Melissa Kadri and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) on Wednesday for a press conference on some of the internet bills being considered by Congress. Along with criticizing the EARN IT and STOP CSAM proposals, the event's speakers sounded the alarm about the Kids Online Safety Act (KOSA) and Restricting the Emergence of Security Threats that Risk Information and Communications Technology (RESTRICT) Act. \u201cThe Kids Online Safety Act would require surveillance of anyone 16 and under on social media, and would put the tools of censorship in the hands of state attorneys general.

""And that is true for so many children, particularly LGBTQ kids who are facing unprecedented assaults across the country.""Citing Fred Rogers' philosophy that what can be mentioned can be managed, Greer added that ""a lot of these bills are based on the idea that we protect our kids by sequestering them off from discussion of these important topics; unfortunately, we actually know from evidence and data that that harms our kids, and that our kids are safer when they are able to discuss... with their peers and with experts these issues that affect them. These bills would, unfortunately, cut kids off from those resources, and that's why we believe that they will make kids less safe, and not more safe."" \u201c""When bad things don\u2019t happen, there is no news. This is the paradox of encryption. Because it\u2019s impossible to count \u201cprevented harms,\u201d we can\u2019t put a number on the vast number of children encryption has protected.

723,DeSantis,2023-05-05,"""DeSantis and Netanyahu Are Anti-Democratic Brothers-in-Arms""","Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, ahead of his expected presidential run, flew all the way to Israel to give the keynote address at an event at the Museum of Tolerance April 27. A press release announcing the speech said he was going to “introduce changemakers to those who embrace tolerance and acceptance.” Though it’s hard to believe, this is actually not a joke. DeSantis, who is well-known for his lack of tolerance (and that is being extremely generous) and for leading Florida down a path of breath-taking anti-democratic measures and extreme repression arrived in Israel just as the reality of Israel’s unjust system—and its intolerance (again, that’s extremely generous)—couldn’t be more visible. What DeSantis wants for Florida, and indeed for the U.S. given his national aspirations, is what Israel’s leaders are also committed to: further cementing an authoritarian, anti-democratic, repressive government that has absolutely no regard for human rights, international law, or justice. For four months hundreds of thousands of Israelis have been protesting Israel’s increasingly repressive actions and policies, and specifically the government plan under the leadership of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu to overhaul its judiciary. As Palestinians and many others have made clear, they should also be protesting (and some are) Israel’s ongoing inhumane treatment of its Palestinian citizens and those living under its military occupation without the most basic of rights. In fact, many of Israel’s fundamental laws and policies are antithetical to equal rights—and always have been. Palestinian, Israeli, and international human rights organizations have documented the inhumanity and injustice of Israel’s apartheid system (which echoes what Palestinians have been saying for decades). The Museum of Tolerance in downtown Jerusalem, where DeSantis spoke at a “Faces of Israel” conference sponsored by The Jerusalem Post, was built on top of the Mamilla cemetery, an ancient Muslim burial ground and historic site believed to date back to the seventh century. Years ago the Simon Wiesenthal Center, flexing its fundraising muscle, decided to build a version of its Museum of Tolerance in Los Angeles in the heart of Jerusalem. It could only do so once a section of the cemetery was destroyed and desecrated. Another brutal irony. This is not the governor’s first trip to Israel in his official capacity. He chose Israel as the setting of his very first cabinet meeting in April 2019. DeSantis proclaimed with pride during his gubernatorial campaign that he would be the “most pro-Israel governor in America.” His close relationships with, and vociferous support for, Israel’s violent settler movement and its government are a testament to that commitment. DeSantis boasts of how important to him his relationship with Israel continues to be. What he wants for Florida, and indeed for the U.S. given his national aspirations, is what Israel’s leaders are also committed to: further cementing an authoritarian, anti-democratic, repressive government that has absolutely no regard for human rights, international law, or justice. The “tolerance” DeSantis intended to applaud in Israel, his repressive notions of “freedom,” like Israel’s, seem to require that ugly histories of racism, settler colonialism, and injustice (rooted in white supremacy in the case of the U.S. and Jewish supremacy in the case of Israel) be whitewashed and built over. His relentless assaults on, and pushing of legislation that harms, students, trans and queer people, immigrants, Black people, and anyone concerned about the rights of all human beings to live in dignity go hand in glove with his support for Israel’s denial of rights to the Palestinian people. The threat posed by DeSantis and by his counterparts in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s government, cannot be minimized. DeSantis and Netanyahu met during the governor's visit. They are bulldozers and have no shame. But, at the same time, the resistance is strong and principled, and this cannot be underestimated. People from Florida to Palestine/Israel are fighting with conviction to resist the tide of fascism and to say no to repression and to inhumane and anti-democratic policies and actions. Immigrant rights, racial justice, education, and other groups—through walk-outs, protesting in the streets, opposing draconian legislation, and building powerful, interconnected resistance movements—are standing up to DeSantis’s full-fledged attacks on trans and queer people, Black people, and all people of color, to his censorship, and to his attempt to destroy public education and to erase the histories and lived experiences of marginalized students. Meanwhile, Palestinians and supporters of Palestinian justice continue to organize globally, resisting in every way possible, including calling for boycott of Israel until it complies with basic principles of human rights and international law and ceases to torture and kill Palestinians, demolish their land, steal their homes, and deny them their fundamental rights to freedom, justice, and dignity. In positioning himself as a contender in the upcoming presidential election and working to secure his base, DeSantis is doing acrobatics to outflank Trump in his support for Israel’s brutal government. This is not a stretch for him because his vision for Florida and for the United States, and the Netanyahu government’s vision for itself, couldn’t be more compatible—or, I might add, dangerous.",Common Dreams,Business,No,23.25315563961655,80.6505538408224,84.8808031010777,42.5745454434489,46.544104368328036,73.38682105948116,desantis netanyahu,{},"{'run': 'presidential', 'address': 'keynote', 'measures': 'democratic', 'repression': 'extreme', 'system': 'unjust', 'aspirations': 'national', 'government': 'brutal', 'rights': 'fundamental', 'law': 'international', 'actions': 'repressive', 'others': 'many', 'treatment': 'inhumane', 'citizens': 'palestinian', 'occupation': 'military', 'laws': 'fundamental', 'organizations': 'international', 'ground': 'muslim', 'site': 'historic', 'century': 'seventh', 'irony': 'brutal', 'trip': 'first', 'capacity': 'official', 'meeting': 'first', 'campaign': 'gubernatorial', 'governor': 'israel', 'relationships': 'close', 'support': 'vociferous', 'movement': 'violent', 'notions': 'repressive', 'histories': 'ugly', 'supremacy': 'jewish', 'assaults': 'relentless', 'people': 'black', 'beings': 'human', 'time': 'same', 'policies': 'democratic', 'justice': 'palestinian', 'groups': 'other', 'legislation': 'draconian', 'movements': 'interconnected', 'attacks': 'fledged', 'education': 'public', 'experiences': 'lived', 'students': 'marginalized', 'way': 'possible', 'principles': 'basic', 'election': 'presidential'}",1,1
724,DeSantis,2023-05-05,"""Nazi Germany and the Contemporary Republican Party""","[T]wo equally convenient solutions; both dispense with the necessity of reflection. —Jules Henri Poincaré Republican governors and legislators would be the first to tell you that what they are doing is not the same as what the Nazis were doing in the 1930s. When the Nazis came to power in 1933 and during the first six years of Hitler’s dictatorship, more than 400 decrees were promulgated that restricted all aspects of public and private Jewish lives in Nazi Germany. The United States is not Nazi Germany. Select Republican governors and legislatures are not doing anything that vaguely resembles what the Nazis did to control the personal lives of their citizens. Of course, some states have passed laws that could confuse someone trying to distinguish legislation enacted by the Nazis targeting Jews and legislation in the United States targeting those with different sexual orientation from the legislators enacting the laws in the United States. In Ohio, legislation has been passed that bans gender-affirming care for youth who have gender dysphoria and bans Ohio residents from going to another state for abortions. In Montana, a law was just signed that bans transgender care for minors and prohibits transitional hormone treatments and surgeries for transgender people under the age of 18. Idaho has just passed a law that criminalizes gender-affirming health care for youth who have gender dysphoria and bans puberty blockers and hormones for people under age 18. Since the first of the year more than a dozen states have passed legislation affecting the medical rights of their citizens. There are other areas in which apparent similarities are in fact not similarities. The Nazis banned all Jews from their legislatures. Nothing like that has happened in the United States. In fact, as of this writing only two state legislatures have banned members. In Tennessee, legislators voted to expel two of their black members. (A third person who participated in the offensive conduct was not expelled. She was white.) Republican members of the Tennessee legislature were quick to explain that the legislators who were expelled were expelled because of their breach of decorum on the floor of the legislature and not because of the color of their skin or their sexual preferences. Breach of decorum in Tennessee is an offense almost as serious as being Jewish in Nazi Germany. One of the Republicans who voted to expel his two black colleagues said the two had acted with “disrespect” and showed “no remorse” for their actions. He said they had conducted a “mutiny.” In Montana, Democratic lawmaker Zooey Zephyr is a transgender member of the Montana House of Representatives. Zooey was banned from attending or speaking during floor sessions of the House and will only be allowed to vote remotely during the last days of the session. That is because she spoke out against a bill passed by her colleagues that bans gender-affirming care. She is a transgender member of the legislature that can longer fully participate on behalf of her constituents. The Germans never expelled Jews from their legislatures. Of course, Jews were not admitted to their legislatures in the first place. As anyone who has read a book knows, the contents of a book can have a profound effect on the reader. The only way to avoid that result is to keep books from readers. Nazis dealt with the problem posed by books containing content deemed inappropriate by those in control very differently from people in the United States who disapprove of books. On May 10, 1933, German universities participated in organized book burnings of books that were believed by the arsonists to reflect an “un-German spirit.” The goal was to remove Jewish influence from German society. The burning of the books was cause for great celebration. In Berlin, an estimated 40,000 people gathered to watch the burning of the books. Republican Ron DeSantis, the governor of Florida, and others like him who fear the contents of books and their effect on readers, have taken a different approach from the Nazis. They do not think the books should be burned. They think that books with inappropriate content as determined by them and other critics, should be removed from library shelves so as to render them inaccessible to readers. Although DeSantis has received the most publicity for banning books, Texas has in fact banned the most books. It has banned 800 books in 22 school districts. DeSantis comes in second best having banned 566 books in 21 of the state’s school districts. DeSantis has, among other things, banned books that deal with issues related to race which is similar to banning books dealing with or written by Jews as the Nazis did. Like Florida, Pennsylvania has many book bans in place and in many counties has banned books that are centered on people of color. Nazi Germany is well known for its treatment of Jews. The United States is becoming well known for its treatment of the LGBTQ+ community, people of color, and other minorities.

Is somebody, who got there first, showing them the way?It appears there’s an answer, one that grows clearer every day.Viktor Orbán’s Hungary is hosting the CPAC Republican fascist-fest this week in Budapest, where the Hungarian “soft fascism” strongman president told the audience, to a standing ovation:“Hungary is actually an incubator where experiments are done on the future of conservative policies. Hungary is the place where we didn’t just talk about defeating the progressives and liberals and causing a conservative Christian political turn, but we actually did it.”Orbán’s Fidesz Party and the GOP in most Red States have become virtually indistinguishable, from cronies owning the media, to packing the courts, to rigging elections through purging voters and gerrymanders, to putting polluting businesses in charge of regulatory agencies.Now both have their sights set on the American federal government. Seriously, both. Orbán is now inserting himself into American Republican politics in a big way: last August he gave a major speech to Republicans in Dallas. Orbán has become a role model for many American politicians, particularly those in the GOP’s Sedition Caucus. Steve Bannon celebrated Orbán as “Trump before Trump,” and Casey Michel on the NBC News site Think noted: “From targeting migrants to inflaming an ethnonationalist base, from attacking the press to whipping up nativist conspiracies, from ushering in unprecedented corruption to tearing down basic democratic protections, Trumpism is increasingly indistinguishable from Orbánism.”So, who is this guy, and what can we learn about the direction Republicans want to take America from his example they appear to be following?I first heard of Orbán in August of 1989, when my best friend Jerry Schneiderman and I spent the better part of a week sitting in outdoor cafes on the Buda side of the Danube River, eating extraordinary (and cheap!) food, staying in a grand old hotel, and generally exploring Budapest.Two months earlier there had been massive pro-democracy demonstrations involving hundreds of thousands of people demanding that the Soviet Union let Hungary go. The summer we were there, over a quarter-million showed up in Heroes’ Square for the reinterment of the body of Imre Nagy, a hero of the ill-fated 1956 rebellion against the USSR. The final speaker was 26-year-old Viktor Orbán, a rising politician who would soon be a member of Parliament. To an explosion of enthusiastic cheers, Orbán defied the Soviets (the only speaker to overtly do so) and openly called for “the swift withdrawal of Russian troops.”Nine months later, in March of 1990 and with the approval of Mikhail Gorbachev, Hungary held its first real elections since 1945; in 1999, it joined NATO; and in 2004, it became a member of the European Union.And then, when he acquired power, Viktor Orbán succeeded in pulling off what Donald Trump had only tried.For 20 years, Hungary was a functioning democracy; today, it’s a corrupt neofascist oligarchy. Europeans refer to it as “soft fascism.”In the few short years after he was elected in 2010, Prime Minister Viktor Orbán, now fabulously wealthy by Hungarian standards and an oligarch himself, succeeded in transforming his nation’s government from a functioning European democracy into an autocratic and oligarchic regime of single-party neofascist rule.Republicans now want to do the same here, and the Hungarian strongman has dedicated himself to showing them how.Orbán took over the Fidesz Party, once a conventional “conservative” political party like the GOP, with the themes: “Restore Christian purity” and “Make Hungary great again.” His rallies regularly drew tens of thousands.He campaigned on building a wall across the entirety of Hungary’s southern border to keep out the brown-skinned “rapists and murderers” fleeing Russian violence in Syria, a promise he has largely kept.He altered the nation’s Constitution to enable what we’d call gerrymandering and voter suppression in much the same way Republicans are now doing across Red State America, ensuring that his party, Fidesz, would win a majority of the votes in pretty much every election well into the future.He’s packed the courts just like Trump and McConnell did, particularly Hungary’s equivalent of the Supreme Court, so thoroughly that even the most serious legal challenges against him and his party go nowhere. Under Orbán, Hungary passed laws requiring “conservative” sex education in schools (“gay is bad” and “abstinence only”) and criminalized any positive portrayal of LGBTQ people on TV. In public campaigns he’s conflated homosexuality with pedophilia and the penalties are draconian. The latest anti-gay law passed the Hungarian Parliament by a vote of 157 to 1. Republicans are trying to do the same here. Ron DeSantis is running, in Florida, a virtual clone of Orbán’s agenda in his effort to become the US president. Right down to creating his own private army and police force answerable only to himself.Orbán’s party railed against teaching multiracialism and racial tolerance, instead rewriting elementary school textbooks to proclaim that refugees entering the country are a threat because “it can be problematic for different cultures to coexist.” Using this logic, he has locked up brown-skinned Syrian refugee children in cages with the enthusiastic support of Hungarian white supremacists.When the Helsinki Committee said Hungary’s “indefinite detention of many vulnerable migrants, including families with small children, is cruel and inhuman,” Orbán said the influx of Syrian refugees seeking asylum “poses a security risk and endangers the continent’s Christian culture and identity.” He added, in true fascist style, “Immigration brings increased crime, especially crimes against women, and lets in the virus of terrorism.”Five years and one week before Trump applauded the “Jews will not replace us” American Nazis who rallied in Charlottesville and murdered Heather Heyer, a group of some 700 right-wing “patriots” held a torchlight parade that ended in front of the homes of Hungary’s largest minority group, chanting “We will set your homes on fire!”Orbán’s police watched the thugs, laughing and refusing to intervene, as Roma families fled their homes in terror. In 2013, Zsolt Bayer, one of the founders of Orbán’s party, had called the Roma “animals… unfit to live among people.” Orbán refused to condemn him or the violence, and life has become more and more difficult for racial, ethnic, and religious minorities. Not only are they routinely excluded from job markets, but are also frequently subject to violence at the hands of all-white “militias.”Orbán has handed government contracts to his favored few, elevating an entire group of pro-Orbán businessmen (it appears all are men) who have now seized almost complete control of the nation’s economy. Those who opposed him have lost their businesses, been forced to sell their companies, and often fled the country.Virtually all of Hungary’s press is now in the hands of oligarchs and corporations loyal to Orbán, with hard-right talk radio and television across the country singing his praises daily. Progressive media is functionally banned. Billboards and social media proclaim Orbán’s patriotism. He told the American CPAC conference in Budapest last year they should do the same in America when Republicans next seize control of the US government:“Have your own media,” he said. “It’s the only way to point out the insanity of the progressive left. The problem is that the western media is adjusted to the leftist viewpoint. Those who taught reporters in universities already had progressive leftist principles.”He added:“Of course, the GOP has its media allies but they can’t compete with the mainstream liberal media. My friend Tucker Carlson is the only one who puts himself out there. His show is the most popular. What does it mean? It means programs like his should be broadcasted day and night. Or, as you say, 24/7.”After his 2022 speech was publicized in the US, many American media outlets were banned from attending CPAC in Budapest. As Vice News reported:“Besides VICE News, journalists from Rolling Stone, Vox Media, and the New Yorker were turned away from the conference on Thursday, despite repeated assurances from the American Conservative Union that access would be provided. Journalists from other non-Hungarian media outlets, including the Guardian and Associated Press, tweeted that they had also been denied accreditation, despite months of requests.”His media allies are now reaching out to purchase media across the rest of Europe and inviting American rightwing groups to Hungary to help spread his racist, “soft fascist” message. Tucker Carlson took him up on his invitation last year, broadcasting his poison directly into American homes from his presidential palace.Yesterday, in his opening comments, CPAC chairman (and accused sexual harasser) Matt Schlapp echoed Orbán’s strategy, as the Associated Press noted:“In opening comments, CPAC chairman Matt Schlapp said that CPAC in the U.S. had decided to ‘go Hungarian’ in their approach to the media, deciding for themselves ‘who is a journalist and who is not a journalist’ when determining which outlets to allow into their events.”But journalism isn’t the only institution fascists want to tear down. Orbán recently began dismantling the Hungarian Science Academy, replacing or simply firing scientists who acknowledge climate change, which he has called “left-wing trickery made up by Barack Obama.”The world, in particular the EU, has watched this rolling political nightmare with increasing alarm, and even the EU’s 2015 and 2018 attempts to essentially impeach Orbán have backfired. EU criticism of him increased his two reelection margins, as his handmaids in the Hungarian media proclaimed him the victim of a European “deep state.” They say that meddling foreigners, particularly Jewish financier George Soros (who, ironically, once paid for young Orbán to attend college in Britain), are bent on imposing “tyrannical” government strictures on Hungary.In May 2020, the same month Rudy Giuliani said he had a former Ukrainian prosecutor willing to testify that Joe Biden was corrupt, Donald Trump invited Orbán to the White House for a state visit; Orbán became one of Trump’s two primary sources of lies about how Ukraine’s Zelenskyy allegedly tried to sabotage the U.S. president.Orbán has helped violent theocrats fully reinvent Christianity in Hungary, embracing a hard-right movement within the Catholic Church and among Protestant evangelicals. He reshaped Hungary’s abortion laws to make it extremely difficult for a woman to terminate a pregnancy (it must threaten the life of the mother or be the result of a crime). The Central European University fled Hungary in the face of growing threats of violence against progressive religious organizations, a ban on classes, and the tight embrace of rightwing churches by the government. Its rector, Michael Ignatieff, said:“There’s just no doubt that this is organized as a way of saying that ‘Christianity’ means ‘white conservative Europe’. It’s a trope. Say the world ‘Christian’ and it says everything else that you want to say.”Thus, Trump told Orbán: “You have been great with respect to Christian communities…and we appreciate that very much.”In a rally three months before his White House meeting with Trump, Orbán said that countries that accept non-Christian or non-white refugees are producing “mixed-race nations,” a trope frequently used in American rightwing media today.Women in Hungary have been marginalized since Orbán came to power, both in business and in government. As the Hungarian Spectrum notes: “According to him, Hungarian politics is built on ‘continual character assassination,’ which … ‘women cannot endure.’” As noted in The Guardian in 2018: “Orbán’s Fidesz party and its coalition partners the Christian Democrats have 133 MPs between them, of whom just 11 are women.” Orbán is now ruthlessly using his own nation’s diplomatic and criminal justice systems to aid foreign criminal oligarchs, having surrounded himself with corrupt yes-men. He has increasingly turned Hungary into a place of refuge for corrupt oligarchs and neofascists from other nations, most famously granting “asylum to convicted felon, fascist oligarch, and former Prime Minister of Macedonia Nikola Gruevski” in 2018.Orbán is the only leader of an EU nation to refuse to condemn Putin for his slaughter in Ukraine, saying he doesn’t want to get “between the Ukrainian anvil and the Russian sledgehammer.” He refers to those in Hungary who support Ukraine as “warmongers,” and refuses to participate in the EU embargoes of Russian fossil fuels.Orbán has now largely crushed dissent in Hungary, arresting opposition politicians, “troublemakers,” and members of the independent press. As Zach Beauchamp writes for Vox: “At dawn on a Tuesday in May, the police took a man named András from his home in northeastern Hungary. His alleged crime? Writing a Facebook post that called the country’s prime minister, Viktor Orbán, a ‘dictator.’”Orbán’s hard-right party is also reaching out to other white supremacist parties in Europe to forge alliances to overthrow the “liberal order” of the EU. Conservatives in America are taking notice and writing glowing pieces about him, as rightwing movements across the world draw inspiration from both Orbán and Putin.The international movement away from democracy and toward strongman authoritarian fascist and neofascist government is growing, and Viktor Orbán is one of its rising stars. According to the Freedom in the World 2020 Report from Freedom House, 25 of the world’s 41 established democracies experienced net losses in 2019, and the report downgraded the freedom scores of 73 countries, representing 75 percent of the global population.Putin, Xi, and Orbán are leaders of this movement, with Orbán having the greatest influence over the American Republican Party. The tight embrace he’s held with by rightwing hate radio, Fox “News,” the GOP, and our domestic conservative movement make clear the danger of America sliding into the sort of “soft fascism” that Viktor Orbán has pioneered in Hungary. If you want to see the GOP’s vision of America’s future, just visit that nation.Forewarned is forearmed.

728,DeSantis,2023-05-05,"""Florida Parents Vow Legal Fight After GOP Passes 'Dangerous' Attack on Gender-Affirming Care""","Florida Republicans on Thursday approved a draconian bill that, among other things, would enable the state to take trans children away from their parents if they are receiving gender-affirming healthcare, even though such care is consistent with the guidance of every major medical organization in the United States.In addition to trying to authorize kidnapping, Senate Bill 254 also seeks to limit the ability of trans adults to start or continue receiving gender-affirming care and threatens to put doctors who violate the new restrictions behind bars.The legislation—condemned by civil rights advocates as the Criminalizing Gender-Affirming Care Bill—passed the state Senate in a 26-13 vote and the House by a margin of 83-28. It now heads to the desk of far-right Gov. Ron DeSantis. The presumptive candidate for the GOP's 2024 presidential nomination has previously voiced support for the measure and is expected to sign it into law, upon which it would take immediate effect.""S.B. 254 is extraordinarily dangerous and extreme in a year full of extreme, discriminatory legislation.""Seven Florida parents who are currently challenging state boards of Medicine and Osteopathic Medicine rules prohibiting gender-affirming care for their children and other trans youth plan to ask a federal court to block provisions in S.B. 254 that would codify the existing boards' bans and create additional barriers for families with trans children.They are represented by Southern Legal Counsel, GLBTQ Legal Advocates & Defenders (GLAD), the National Center for Lesbian Rights, and the Human Rights Campaign (HRC). The groups issued a joint statement denouncing Florida for ""doubl[ing] down on denying science, intruding on family privacy and parental decision-making, and trampling on the rights and well-being of transgender adolescents.""""The bill passed by the Legislature today interferes even further with families, deliberately provoking conflict by inviting challenges to established custody orders. This exacerbates the state of emergency for parents who are already being forced to watch their kids suffer rather than get them the effective healthcare they need and that will allow them to thrive,"" says the statement. ""We will take swift action to ask the federal court to block the ban on access to essential healthcare in S.B. 254, as well as the boards of medicine bans, to stop further harm to transgender youth and their families while the plaintiffs' case continues.""Similar bans on gender-affirming care for trans youth have been blocked by federal judges in Alabama, Arkansas, and Missouri.Under S.B. 254, the state could take custody of a child who ""has been subjected to or is threatened with being subjected to"" gender-affirming care such as hormone replacement therapy and puberty blockers.As The New Republic reported:Florida courts could modify custody agreements from a different state if the minor is likely to receive gender-affirming care in that second state. The text refers to gender-affirming care as ""sex-reassignment prescriptions or procedures"" and qualifies this care as a form of ""physical harm.""Medical facilities would have to give the state Department of Health a signed attestation that they neither provide gender-affirming care to any patients under the age of 18 nor refer people to providers that do. Their medical license renewal is contingent upon sending in this attestation.[...]Minors who have already begun transitioning will be allowed to continue to do so, but they are no longer allowed to receive care via telehealth, including for prescriptions. Their doctors have to tell them about the ""risks"" of gender-affirming care, and patients will have to sign an informed consent form, which the ACLU has pointed out often contains misinformation. Doctors who violate any of these new rules could be charged with a felony.Equality Florida, the state's largest LGBTQ+ rights group, noted that ""while much of the bill proponents' rhetoric focused on transgender youth, multiple bill provisions impact consenting transgender adults."" As the organization explained, ""The bill bans government entities from offering them gender-affirming healthcare insurance, restricts their ability to access telehealth for care in the way nearly all other healthcare can be delivered, and denies their ability to receive care from highly trained nurses that provide a large portion of the gender-affirming care in the state."" Anyone who violates these provisions could face misdemeanor charges.As repressive as S.B. 254 is, opponents successfully narrowed the bill from the ""much more extreme"" House companion filed by state Rep. Randy Fine (R-33), the group pointed out. ""Provisions previously approved by the House majority would have banned private health insurance providers from covering care for transgender adults and barred transgender Floridians from updating the gender on their birth certificates. The bill as passed also allows certain transgender youth already receiving gender-affirming treatments to continue doing so, whereas the House provisions would have terminated all care by the end of the year."" \u201cThe Gender Affirming Care Ban has passed the Florida Legislature and now goes to the Governor\u2019s Desk. This is a breakdown of the amended version, provided by civl rights\u00a0attorney Simone Chriss.\n\nClick here for text & PDF version: https://t.co/E8oqAX0vOz\u201d — Rep. Anna V. Eskamani \ud83d\udd28 (@Rep. Anna V. Eskamani \ud83d\udd28) 1683291127 Equality Florida public policy director Jon Harris Maurer said that S.B. 254 ""painfully shows Gov. DeSantis' 'Florida freedom' farce.""""It's an assault on medical freedom and the freedom to parent,"" Maurer lamented. ""After weaponizing the state's Medicaid agency and Board of Medicine against the transgender community, the governor's surrogates have now rammed through legislation to override parental decision-making, jail Florida doctors following best practices, and force adults to jump through government hoops to access their daily medication. This crusade is about political aspirations, but it has real-world consequences for Florida families.""Maurer's critical assessment was echoed by Cathryn Oakley, HRC's state legislative director and senior counsel.""S.B. 254 is extraordinarily dangerous and extreme in a year full of extreme, discriminatory legislation,"" said Oakley. ""This bill doesn't even pretend to be responsible public policy—instead, it attacks the ability of people of all ages to access medically necessary healthcare simply because those people are transgender; it prevents parents from being able to access best-practice, potentially lifesaving healthcare supported by the entire American medical establishment on behalf of their children; it prevents healthcare providers from delivering best-practice medical care; and it even threatens to overturn out-of-state custody determinations.""""This bill doesn't even pretend to be responsible public policy—instead, it attacks the ability of people of all ages to access medically necessary healthcare.""Oakley warned that ""if Gov. DeSantis signs this bill, he will be disrespecting the United States Constitution as well as the rule of law, not to mention transgender Floridians, their families, and their medical care providers.""""Many families are making plans to leave the state to protect their children and get them the care they need to stay alive,"" she added. ""The Human Rights Campaign is committed to doing everything in our power to fight back against these discriminatory bills and give LGBTQ+ children the futures they deserve.""S.B. 254, The New Republic observed, is ""one of the cruelest"" anti-trans bills yet passed in the country. ""State Republicans have openly admitted they 'hate' LGBTQ people and are comfortable with 'erasing' the community from existence.""Equality Florida urged people to call DeSantis' office at 850-717-9337 to assert that ""hate has no place"" in the state.As the organization noted, ""S.B. 254's passage comes amidst an unprecedented barrage of anti-LGBTQ, anti-freedom bills in the final week of the 2023 legislative session,"" all of which DeSantis is expected to sign into law. It elaborated:On Tuesday, the Legislature passed S.B. 1580, known as the License to Discriminate in Healthcare bill, which creates a broad license for healthcare providers and insurance companies to refuse services based on a ""religious, moral, or ethical belief."" Despite fears from LGBTQ advocates that this could open the door for discrimination in healthcare services, the bill passed on a party-line vote.On Wednesday, three bills on the Slate of Hate were sent to the governor. H.B. 1069, the Don't Say LGBTQ Expansion Bill... extends last year's censorship of classroom discussion of sexual orientation and gender identity now up to eighth grade and overrides a parent's right to ensure that school personnel address their transgender child with the correct title and pronouns. The bill also dramatically accelerates book-banning efforts in Florida, allowing any person in a county to automatically remove a book from school shelves pending a lengthy review on the grounds of certain objections. The Legislature then passed H.B. 1521, the Anti-Transgender Bathroom Ban, that imposes new restrictions mandating that bathroom use be separated by sex assigned at birth in schools, universities, public stadiums, regional convention centers, airports, and all government buildings. And finally, H.B. 999, which included language banning public funding for LGBTQ-inclusive diversity and inclusion programs in our state colleges and universities.Florida's hateful offensive is part of a broader nationwide attack carried out by Republican lawmakers and officials. The GOP claims to be ""protecting children,"" but in reality, it is criminalizing LGBTQ+ people of all ages, putting them at increased risk of violence and self-harm.HRC said it is opposing more than 520 anti-LGBTQ+ bills introduced in statehouses across the country so far in 2023. According to the group, ""More than 220 of those bills would specifically restrict the rights of transgender people, the highest number of bills targeting transgender people in a single year to date.""HRC is currently tracking:More than 125 bills that would prevent transgender youth from being able to access age-appropriate, medically necessary, best-practice healthcare; this year, 13 have already become law in Arkansas, Tennessee, Mississippi, South Dakota, Utah, Iowa, Idaho, Indiana, Georgia, Kentucky, West Virginia, North Dakota, and Montana;More than 30 bathroom ban bills; andMore than 100 curriculum censorship bills and 45 anti-drag performance bills.""In a coordinated push led by national anti-LGBTQ+ groups, which deployed vintage discriminatory tropes, politicians in statehouses across the country introduced 315 discriminatory anti-LGBTQ+ bills in 2022,"" HRC noted. ""Despite this, fewer than 10% of these efforts [29] succeeded. The majority of the discriminatory bills—149 bills—targeted the transgender and nonbinary community, with the majority targeting children... By the end of the 2022 legislative session, a record 17 bills attacking transgender and nonbinary children passed into law.""""Support for LGBTQ+ rights is on the rise in Florida and nationwide,"" the group pointed out, citing recent survey data showing that 80% of Florida residents back anti-discrimination protections and 66% oppose refusal of service on religious groups.

They are demanding the right to learn their history and that of their forebears, even if it makes others “uncomfortable.” The day of protest fell on an auspicious anniversary. Sixty years earlier, on May 3rd, 1963, thousands of young people risked their lives in Birmingham, Alabama, on the second day of what became known as The Children’s Crusade. Images of the march shocked people worldwide, as Black children and teens engaging in non-violent protest were brutalized with police dogs, clubs and water cannons.Birmingham was considered the Jim Crow South’s most segregated and most violent city, controlled for decades by a racist political boss named Bull Connor. The courage demonstrated by those young people that day was remarkable, and contributed to enduring change – change that is now threatened.“Sixty years ago today, I woke up with my mind on freedom,” Children’s Crusade participant Janice Kelsey recalled, speaking on the Democracy Now! news hour. “I had attended student nonviolent workshops, and I was prepared, because I finally understood that it was more than just segregation, it was inequality.”Janice Kelsey continued, “In the preparation sessions that were held at 16th Street Baptist Church, we had seen film of demonstrations in other places, so I saw people being hit, being called names and being mistreated for demonstrating. We were told that if you participate, some of this may happen to you, but this is a nonviolent movement, and you cannot respond, except to pray or sing a freedom song…I was so incensed at having been mistreated all these years, until I was willing to sacrifice whatever was necessary to take steps to change the environment.”The Birmingham campaign was planned in secret in January, 1963 by Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. and a handful of his closest associates, including the Rev. Ralph Abernathy, James Bevel and Fred Shuttlesworth. The late Harry Belafonte rescued King’s Southern Christian Leadership Conference from near bankruptcy, raising for the Birmingham campaign, in one night at a fundraiser he hosted, close to $500,000 – almost $5 million in 2023 dollars. This history is detailed in the newly published book, “You Have to Be Prepared to Die Before You Can Begin to Live: Ten Weeks in Birmingham That Changed America,” by Paul Kix. The title’s first sentence comes from words Shuttlesworth spoke at Belafonte’s fundraiser.Days later, the Birmingham campaign began, as Kix quotes King, to “break segregation or be broken by it.” When it didn’t take off with hoped-for intensity, King himself marched and was arrested. While in Bull Connor’s jail, he clandestinely penned “The Letter from Birmingham Jail.”One of King’s key advisors was Vincent Harding, an African American war veteran who had embraced non-violence. Speaking on Democracy Now! in 2008, Harding explained the Children’s Campaign:“There was a whole development in which many of the protesters were young people, and in some cases children, who came to play a crucial role in leading the struggle against segregation, partly because many of the adults were afraid to, couldn’t afford to, were worried about what would happen to them and their livelihoods if they did it.”Vincent Harding played a role in helping King deliver his secretly-penned letter, which explained why American Blacks, especially in the South, were tired of waiting for change.“We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed,” King wrote. “We have waited for more than 340 years for our constitutional and God given rights.”340 years before 1963 was 1623, four years after 1619, the year the first ship carrying enslaved Africans arrived on the shores of what would become the United States.History matters. And right now the right-wing is attempting to obliterate the often violent, racist history of the United States.“It’s very discouraging and frightening to see leaders in legislatures and governors who are trying to push back on the gains that were made due to the tremendous sacrifices that were made by young people 60 years ago…I’m hoping and praying that our young people will step up again and say, ‘No, we are not going back,’” Janice Kelsey said.As this column was going to press, ten young Dream Defenders, committed to racial justice, were occupying the office of Republican Florida Gov. Ron Desantis. “He stokes division to try and make white people afraid and I’m here to say that we will not be divided…we are stronger when we stand together,” Julia Daniel, one of the occupiers, said in a statement.Janice Kelsey needn’t worry.

738,DeSantis,2023-05-06,"""Right-Wing Policy Is the Cause of the Crisis at the Border""","I recently came across a tweet from Stephen Miller, Donald Trump’s architect of the absolutely unconscionable family separation policy at the border. The tweet reads, “Joe Biden is the trafficker-in-chief. No one on earth is responsible for more child trafficking than Joe Biden.” This tweet is absurd on its face because Joe Biden is not actively engaging in human trafficking, unlike Governors Ron DeSantis of Florida and Greg Abbott of Texas, who have utilized public funds and fraud to send migrants to Martha’s Vineyard and Vice President Kamala Harris’ home, using people who have fled from desperate situations as human props. Even though this tweet is ridiculous, it is useful because it perfectly encapsulates the conservative narrative on immigration. As immigrant advocates and progressives, we need to understand their narrative and have a clear recognition that it is completely backward. They will tell you that some fictitious “open border” policy is the cause of the crisis at the border, but the reality is that right wing policies in different areas overlap to create the perfect storm where people are desperately fleeing their home countries, only to be turned away by the U.S. and forced to cross the border in a dangerous manner.Miller’s narrative essentially boils down to this: Joe Biden’s “open border” policies make it too easy for people to come to the U.S., which causes human trafficking. This is illogical on its face because people would not resort to using “coyotes” to get themselves and their loved ones into the U.S. if they had a practical and legal method to immigrate, and they wouldn’t be so desperate to escape in the first place if there weren’t so many dangerous situations at home. The many disruptions in their home countries caused by right-wing U.S. policy, coupled with the lack of a legal option for immigrating to the U.S., are the principal causes of the crisis at the border.The 1-2 Punch Causing the Border Crisis: Disruption at Home and Militarized U.S. Border PolicyA useful thought experiment would be to ask yourself this question: What kind of situation would you have to be in that would cause you to flee from your home country through dangerous conditions, only to arrive in a foreign country that may or may not take you in? It is helpful to keep this in mind because it counters the traditional right wing thinking that people arriving at the southern border are “bad hombres” as Donald Trump famously put it. I would argue that most people would only leave their lives behind and embark on this journey if they felt like they had no other option.President Biden’s record on immigration has been mixed at best, but there is one policy he is pursuing that has the potential to help alleviate the crisis at the border.Why do citizens of countries like El Salvador, Honduras, Guatemala, Haiti, and many others, feel like they have to leave their home countries? U.S. policies have disrupted the affairs of these countries for years in numerous ways. For example, the right wing U.S. Supreme Court effectively gave the green light to unlimited gun sales through its decision in D.C. v. Heller. Many of these guns flow south to our neighboring countries, where criminals and gangs use them to commit violence against the citizenry. This “iron river” has created a situation where nearly 70% of the guns recovered from crimes in Mexico are U.S. sourced. That number is a staggering 80% in the Caribbean. Organized crime and gang violence are a significant cause of people fleeing their home countries. They are made much deadlier by U.S. weapons manufactured and sold under the current, conservative interpretation of the 2nd amendment.Another example of right-wing U.S. policy causing people to flee their home countries is climate change induced drought and hurricanes. The U.S. is the biggest historical emitter of greenhouse gasses, meaning that most of the extra global warming causing gas in the atmosphere came from the U.S. Instead of embracing a Green New Deal that would transition us off fossil fuels and create good jobs, the U.S. has continuously ignored the urgency of climate change and doubled down on fossil fuel production. Climate change intensifies weather patterns like droughts and hurricanes, causing crop failure, property damage, and extreme poverty. Relentless droughts and hurricanes in Central America drove large numbers of people to flee their home countries recently. This will only continue to get worse until the U.S. adopts a progressive climate change policy and begins to reverse the damage already being done.A final example of right-wing U.S. policy causing people to flee their home countries is political interference. The U.S. has a long history of manipulating the political processes of Latin American countries in order to install leaders that are friendly to the U.S. and U.S. business interests. In the infamous “Roosevelt Corollary” to the Monroe Doctrine, Theodore Roosevelt asserted that the U.S. had the right to intervene in the affairs of our neighbors to the south. This concept has never disappeared from U.S. policy.In El Salvador, the U.S. propped up a repressive government that took power through a coup in 1979. This government killed its own citizens, causing a mass exodus to the U.S. Many of these refugees were later deported back to El Salvador, where they brought the U.S. gang culture with them back home, leading to the explosion of gang violence by MS-13. In Honduras, former President Obama and then Secretary of State Hillary Clinton tacitly allowed and refused to condemn the coup of reformist President Manuel Zelaya, which paved the way for a repressive government that was actively involved in drug trafficking, most notably under former President Juan Orlando Hernández. Finally, U.S. sanctions on Venezuela have crippled that country’s economy, while U.S. attempts to overthrow its leftist government, most notably when former President Trump and John Bolton attempted to install Juan Guaidó as the leader by officially recognizing him as President in 2019, have created long term political and social instability. There are many more examples I could give, but the point should be clear that many of the policies championed by conservatives create the destabilizing conditions that cause people to flee their home countries and seek refuge at the southern border. “America first” is essentially a euphemism for, “We don’t care what happens to our neighbors to the south.”“Tougher” Immigration Laws create more illegal ImmigrationThe second part of the problem is that migrants at the southern border do not have a better way to come to the U.S. because of our militarized border and immigration policy. If they had a legal, safe, and humane way to come to the U.S., I am certain they would prefer to use that method instead of crossing the southern deserts, hoping not to die of thirst and heat exhaustion, or fall prey to kidnappers, cartels, and gangs. This is where Miller’s narrative falls apart. Human trafficking happens because our immigration policies make it essentially impossible for people seeking refuge to come to the U.S. in a normalized manner. Migrants at the border without a practical way to enter the U.S. hire “coyotes” or other smugglers to help get them or their loved ones across the border safely. This creates a human rights catastrophe that could be avoided if we stopped treating migrants like an invading army and started treating them like people who need help.If the situation in their home country is desperate enough, people are going to try to seek refuge however they can. Let’s think back to the thought experiment above. If there was a gang menacing your family, and your options were to stay at home and wait to be killed, or cross the U.S. border without documentation to ask for asylum, what would you do? Now ask yourself this, if you were fleeing for your life, would you rather come to the U.S. by showing up at a port of entry at the border and being lawfully admitted into the country, or would you rather cross the desert and hope to get caught by Border Patrol so you can be detained and ask for asylum? Clearly, anyone in this situation would rather come to the U.S. in a lawful, orderly fashion if they could, but absent such a way to come to the U.S., they are going to choose crossing the border any way they can instead of staying at home and facing death.President Biden’s record on immigration has been mixed at best, but there is one policy he is pursuing that has the potential to help alleviate the crisis at the border. He has begun using his authority under the Immigration and Nationality Act, section 212(d)(5)(A) to allow migrants at the southern border into the U.S. under “humanitarian parole”. Congress unambiguously gave the President the authority to “parole,” i.e., to allow people to enter the U.S., for urgent humanitarian reasons or significant public benefit. President Biden has directed U.S. Customs and Border Protection to begin allowing migrants into the U.S. using this authority as they seek refuge from dangerous situations back home.As the Center for American Progress details, this parole program has already been shown to reduce the number of encounters with people crossing the border illegally. The data clearly shows that if you give people a way to come to the U.S. legally, they will do so, which will improve the lives of migrants at the border and reduce human trafficking. Unfortunately, President Biden is coupling this parole program with restrictions on asylum. It seems that Democratic administrations can never fully embrace immigration and always try to have it both ways by opening new avenues to help immigrants on the one hand, while simultaneously shutting down others. The Biden Administration should keep access to asylum open while also implementing new ways for people to apply for humanitarian parole instead of opening one door while closing another.Miller’s implied argument that “weak” immigration laws cause human trafficking is false. In fact, the “tough” approach that conservatives support is largely to blame. We need to push back on the conservative narrative that immigration is a bad thing, and that the militarized approach of the GOP on immigration is helpful. The next time you engage with someone who uses this narrative, ask them why they support policies that cause people to flee their home countries, and why they support policies that force them to cross the border without documentation instead of giving them a safe way to seek refuge.",Common Dreams,Business,No,23.392758840592226,92.27708532333465,8.830097398856822,43.20098284451715,33.342549725042296,10.72156354771171,wing policy,{'wing': 'right'},"{'policy': 'militarized', 'trafficking': 'human', 'funds': 'public', 'situations': 'dangerous', 'props': 'human', 'narrative': 'conservative', 'advocates': 'immigrant', 'recognition': 'clear', 'border': 'southern', 'wing': 'right', 'areas': 'different', 'storm': 'perfect', 'manner': 'normalized', 'ones': 'loved', 'method': 'practical', 'place': 'first', 'disruptions': 'many', 'option': 'other', 'causes': 'principal', 'thought': 'useful', 'conditions': 'destabilizing', 'country': 'foreign', 'thinking': 'traditional', 'hombres': 'bad', 'people': 'most', 'others': 'many', 'ways': 'new', 'light': 'green', 'sales': 'unlimited', '%': 'staggering', 'crime': 'organized', 'cause': 'significant', 'interpretation': 'conservative', 'amendment': '2nd', 'emitter': 'historical', 'warming': 'global', 'gas': 'causing', 'jobs': 'good', 'poverty': 'extreme', 'droughts': 'relentless', 'numbers': 'large', 'example': 'final', 'interference': 'political', 'history': 'long', 'processes': 'political', 'countries': 'american', 'government': 'leftist', 'citizens': 'own', 'term': 'long', 'instability': 'political', 'examples': 'more', 'part': 'second', 'way': 'safe', 'deserts': 'southern', 'exhaustion': 'thirst', 'smugglers': 'other', 'rights': 'human', 'army': 'invading', 'experiment': 'thought', 'fashion': 'orderly', 'parole': 'humanitarian', 'reasons': 'humanitarian', 'benefit': 'public', 'administrations': 'democratic', 'avenues': 'new', 'argument': 'implied', 'laws': 'weak', 'approach': 'militarized', 'thing': 'bad', 'time': 'next'}",1,0

740,DeSantis,2023-05-06,"""Every Day Is Child Abuse Day in Ron DeSantis' Florida. Perpetration, Not Prevention""","Child abuse prevention month ended at the end of March. But in the Florida Legislature, every day is child abuse day. Not prevention. Perpetration, with almost every Republican legislator institutionalizing a system of predation that makes clergymen’s unzipped prowls seem monastic in comparison.The frocked committed their crimes in hiding. The Vatican has been trying to atone. Florida’s legislators are out and proud. They’re giving naked discrimination, predation and violence the cover of law. Welcome to the Sunshine State’s Sharia laws. Few sessions have provided the legal framework for as much state-sponsored and citizen-empowered terrorism against children as this one. You’d have to go back to the Jim Crow era’s systematic dehumanization of blacks for anything comparable. Now it’s open season on LGBTQ kids. Let us count the ways. HB1069 expands the “Don’t Say Gay” law approved last year to all grades through middle school, forbids the use of Safe Space stickers or LGBTQ flags (congratulations, Ms. Christy Chong), and forbids recognition of LGBTQ+ History Month in June. Black History Month is still OK, as long as you only teach the yes-massa version. School staff and students are forbidden from using pronouns that conflict with a child’s birth sex. The Department of Education has the authority to broaden the prohibition through 12th grade without legislation. Last month, it did so.This is not just about words. It’s the denial and erasure of people’s identities down to their most private core. It is the method of genocide.Recall how in 2019 a Matanzas High School chorus teacher refused to refer to a trans student by his chosen name? The teacher was seen as callous or insensitive at the time. The case led to the student’s transfer and his parents’ (successful) two-year campaign to add gender protection in the district’s anti-discrimination policy. Now that teacher or the district would be violating the law if they were to accommodate the student’s chosen pronouns. Those who criticize us fake newscrafters for using terms like “don’t say gay” are right in one respect. The phrase is misleading. It’s too gentle, too Birkenstock. This is not just about words. It’s the denial and erasure of people’s identities down to their most private core. It is the method of genocide.We have precedent–not just in slavery times and Jim Crow: Florida law ostensibly makes it a requirement to teach Holocaust history (ostensibly, because the same legislators and our governor are no less rabid anti-Semites for it, as their Soros-coded vileness reminds us almost daily). In this regard the Florida curriculum might as well be written by a cherry-picking Josef Goebbels. Students will not be taught that before he took on Jews on his quest for an “Aryan master race,” Hitler criminalized all homosexual organizations, or that the ashes of gays and lesbians, not just Jews, gypsies and political prisoners, dusted the countryside around Auschwitz and Dachau.HB 1521 and SB 1674 would ban non-binary people from using the bathroom of their choice, if it doesn’t align with their birth sex. We went through this in 2015. The bills failed then, because not all lawmakers substituted colon polyps for their synapses. But here we are again, with the same fabrications about trans people making bathrooms dangerous for your little boys and girls. It is, in fact, the reverse. Trans are already hugely more victimized by sexual crimes than any other group. “One in two transgender individuals are sexually abused or assaulted at some point in their lives,” the U.S. Justice Department reports. “Some reports estimate that transgender survivors may experience rates of sexual assault up to 66 percent, often coupled with physical assaults or abuse. This indicates that the majority of transgender individuals are living with the aftermath of trauma and the fear of possible repeat victimization.” Call it an exaggeration if you must. It would still be appalling if the numbers were half as dire.That’s before accounting for the consequences of these transgender-ban bills. There is no link between trans bathroom use and crime any different from the prevalent predation of heterosexuals, who don’t usually RSVP to assault anyone, anywhere. Nor would they absurdly put themselves through the hassle of passing off as trans just to enter an opposite-sex bathroom they can enter now, and have been violating for centuries, to attack. I’m sure you can find transgender predators. It’s basic math. But they can’t compete with heteros’ violence.There is documented evidence that bans increase the incidence of sexual assault against trans teens–by 36 percent, according to a Harvard study. Put simply: Florida lawmakers who vote for these bills are not keeping the “demons” and “mutants” out, as Volusia County’s Rep. Webster Barnaby put it in April. They are the enablers of violence and crime. They are enablers of child abuse. And they’re turning the rest of us into the executioners. The LGBTQ-erasure bill and the bathroom bill turn teachers and other school personnel, including counselors, into mandatory collaborators of state spying and denunciation of LGBTQ children or of transgressors of the legalized persecution: teachers must also denounce other teachers or administrators who don’t enforce Sharia. This is what our governor calls the Free State of Florida. The former East German name for it is more accurate: Stasi.This is what our governor calls the Free State of Florida. The former East German name for it is more accurate: Stasi.HB1421 bans health insurance companies from covering gender-affirming care for minors and prohibits “all healthcare practitioners, except Florida-licensed physicians or a physician employed by the Federal Government, from providing gender clinical interventions to adults,” according to a legislative analysis. As with abortion, which Florida now bans after six weeks, lawmakers believe they have a right to your body, not just to that of your child. So much for parental rights when they don’t fit the mullahs’ agenda. There’s plenty of room for debate on gender dysphoria, just as there is on transgender athletes’ participation in competitive sports. Deep research is lacking in both and findings are evolving. Reasonable controls based in science and accommodations based in fairness can and must be the starting point of any regulations. We’ve barely reached that point. Sledge-hammer legislation, like DeSantis’s signature last year on a ban on all transgender girls playing on school teams or his coming signature on HB1421, will cause more segregation and cruelty than address either matter humanely. But crafting fair and humane solutions to these dilemmas has never been the GOP’s intention. The legislative onslaught has barely got to do with transgender people or the alleged protection of children. The party couldn’t care less about either. (See above.) This is all part of a national strategy, honed with Florida’s always special hate sauce, to appeal to the right-wing base and whip up votes in a vacuum of governance and legislative accomplishments that don’t turn back the clock to the 1950s. This is all part of a national strategy, honed with Florida’s always special hate sauce, to appeal to the right-wing base and whip up votes in a vacuum of governance and legislative accomplishments that don’t turn back the clock to the 1950s.Demonizing gays had once been a potent turnout machine. It was key to George W. Bush’s re-election in 2004, when Karl Rove lured out the pitchfork voters by stuffing 11 states’ ballots with anti-marriage-equality initiatives. Citizens indifferent to Bush’s crimes against humanity in Iraq and Afghanistan could at least get excited about playing Taliban at home. The initiatives passed in all 11 states, including Ohio, which made the difference in Bush’s electoral-vote margin. He couldn’t win on fear alone. Loathing clinched it.Courts then ruined it all by wedding the 14th Amendment to marriage equality, culminating in the Supreme Court’s legalization of gay marriage in 2015. Crushed and depressed, Republicans needed a new demon. “We knew we needed to find an issue that the candidates were comfortable talking about,” said Terry Schilling, the president of American Principles Project, a social conservative advocacy group, told The New York Times last Sunday. “And we threw everything at the wall.”Lynching transgender rights stuck. Like the parable of the seeds, the rage grew best in Florida, land of DeSantis, Anita Bryant and moms for bigotry. We modeled Stand Your Ground for the rest of the country in 2005. We modeled union-busting a decade later. Now we’re modeling hetero supremacy. So here we are. Bathroom bans, book bans, drag show bans, pronoun bans, care bans, abortion bans, existence bans. All part of the same arsenal of sanctimony. Just as the blood of children from school shootings is liquid gold to the NRA and gun manufacturers, gang-banging trans rights is solid gold for Republicans scaling their wins to the misfortunes of others.How can it possibly affect my neighbor’s life if my child borrows All Boys Aren’t Blue from the school library or chooses to go by the pronouns of his choice? It won’t, anymore than my neighbor masturbating to Tucker Carlson porn every night will make a difference in your life or mine. But in politics, there’s no business like schadenfreude business: Just as the blood of children from school shootings is liquid gold to the NRA and gun manufacturers, gang-banging trans rights is solid gold for Republicans scaling their wins to the misfortunes of others. Easier still when it’s against defenseless children whose parents you’ve won over as collaborators.In Florida, abusing children is no longer just permissive, as has always been the case with the state’s corporal brutality allowance. If the child has the perversity to defy provisions in the bills outlined above, abuse is now a requirement. It’s not quite the orchestrated collapsing of walls on homos in Taliban stadiums filled with cheering sadists. Ours is a more pernicious, more systematic mandate that makes any of us lucky enough to be in the protected class of white hetero Christians free to marginalize, to demean, to demonize.

We were there as a sit-in against Ron DeSantis’s deluge of anti-democratic legislation that targets the most marginalized Floridians, attacking who they are, who they love and how and what they learn. Floridians’ ability to go to the hospital, vote, and speak honestly about their lives is reason enough to blockade a Governor’s office, but there’s even more at stake. Ron DeSantis will likely run for President and his policies have been replicated in state legislatures across the country. He’s shown he will dismantle democratic institutions quickly and behind closed doors. We should all be alarmed by now, because his authoritarian agenda will harm all of us. It is time for bolder action, including from middle-aged white women like me, who haven’t always done as much as we should have. Ron DeSantis and politicians like him are explicitly trying to appeal to white people, to get us to side with him against our immigrant, neighbors, our Black and Brown neighbors, and blame them for low wages or insufficient public schools, instead of those at the top who are stealing money from workers, disinvested in our schools, and profiting off it all. We’re in a white backlash to the racial justice uprisings of 2020 - a period when white politicians drum up anxiety among white people that has followed every major turning point for Black liberation in our country. They then pass laws - like “tough on crime laws” in the 1970’s and 80’s or Jim Crow Laws following Reconstruction - that harm Black people. Ron DeSantis signed a law banning education about structural racism after a worldwide conversation about structural racism changed people’s view. White people are the single largest base of support for the far right’s heinous agenda. Right now, they’re coming for trans people, queer people like me, Black voters and immigrants, and children. Their long-term agenda is clearly set on destroying abortion access, Medicaid, Social Security, and what democratic institutions we have that work. I’m an alumni of New College of Florida, where I learned about Black liberation and how my life as a white person was better off fighting racism alongside communities of color. That’s why Ron DeSantis engineered a hostile takeover of the college. Things are scary right now, but I’m calling on white people like me to join me identifying our clear shared interest in fighting racism and authoritarianism alongside communities of color. They’re trying to appeal to white people and our families to support their agenda, feel conflicted, or be frozen. We need to organize other white people and join our neighbors of color in deep, active solidarity.

789,DeSantis,2023-05-11,"""Disney CEO Comments On Fight With Florida Governor Ron DeSantis""","The Walt Disney Company CEO Bob Iger has commented on the ongoing legal battle it is waging against Florida governor Ron DeSantis. As part of the company's latest earnings briefing, Iger said Disney's recently filed lawsuit speaks for itself. That said, he reiterated that it is Disney's belief that DeSantis is trying to strip away Disney's special Reedy Creek district as a means of retaliation for Disney's opposition to the ""Don't Say Gay"" legislation in Florida.""This is about one thing and one thing only, and that's retaliating against us for taking a position about pending legislation. And we believe that in us taking that position, we are merely exercising our right to free speech. Also, this is not about special privileges or a level playing field or Disney in any way using its leverage around the state of Florida,"" Iger said.DeSantis is seeking to remove Disney's ""special district"" status in Orlando. Walt Disney himself convinced Florida legislators back in the '60s to give him a special district allowing the company to act semi-autonomously on its grounds when the entertainment legend was establishing EPCOT as a real city of the future. The city never panned out. But the Reedy Creek district and special status remained, and Disney has benefitted in a business sense for decades.Iger pointed out that Florida has more than 2,000 of these special districts--the Daytona Motor Speedway being one of them. These special districts have allowed Disney and others to benefit financially by making it easier to do business. Iger said he recognizes this has been a beneficial thing for Disney, but he also pointed out that Disney's parks in Florida employ over 75,000 people and attract ""tens of millions"" of people to Florida.""So, while it's easy to say that the Reedy Creek special district that was established for us over 50 years ago benefited us, it's misleading to not also consider how much Disney benefited the state of Florida,"" Iger said.Iger said DeSantis is unfairly singling out Disney's own special district status. If the goal was to create a level playing field and a uniform application of law and governance, that would be one thing, but Iger said that is not what's happening here. The executive also said there is a ""false narrative"" circling the case about Disney trying to protect its own tax breaks related to the special district status. Iger said Disney is central Florida's largest taxpayer to the tune of more than $1.1 billion in state taxes in 2022.""There was no concerted effort to do anything to dismantle what was once called Reedy Creek special district until we spoke out on the legislation. So, this is plainly a matter of retaliation while the rest of the Florida special districts continue operating basically as they were,"" Iger said. ""And I think it's also important for us to say our primary goal has always been to be able to continue to do exactly what we've been doing there, which is investing in Florida. We're proud of the tourism industry that we created, and we want to continue delivering the best possible experience for guests going forward.""Iger went on to say that Disney never believed it would be in this position--fighting in court about this matter--considering it had such a good relationship with Florida for the past 50 years. Looking ahead, Iger said DeSantis should think carefully about his ongoing case against Disney. He mentioned that Disney has plans to invest $17 billion in Florida over the next 10 years, and the state of Florida should understand that this is good for them, too, Iger said. He did not specifically threaten to pull back any investment plans, though.""We pay our fair share of taxes. We employ thousands of people. And by the way, we pay them above the minimum wage--substantially above the minimum wage dictated by the state of Florida. And we also provide them with great benefits and free education,"" Iger said.

But there are concerns, too.Iger said Disney is already using AI systems to create ""some efficiencies"" to help serve customers better, though he did not get into specifics. ""Getting closer to the customer is something that is a real goal of ours, and we think that AI will provide some great opportunities to do that,"" he said.At the same time, Iger admitted that AI will probably be a ""highly disruptive"" force, and one that could become ""extremely difficult"" to manage.

""The child, whose death has not been previously reported, was 'medically fragile,' HHS said in a notification to lawmakers at the time.""Meanwhile, CNN obtained the congressional notice for the 17-year-old, who was under the care of the HHS Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) and placed at Gulf Coast Jewish Family and Community Services in Safety Harbor, Florida, on May 5.As CNN detailed: The teen was taken to Mease Countryside Hospital in Safety Harbor Wednesday morning after being found unconscious. He was pronounced dead an hour later despite resuscitation attempts. The minor's parents and sponsor have been notified, according to the notice. An investigation by a medical examiner is underway and ORR said it will continue to receive more information on the death from the care provider. CBS News reported that a U.S. official said there was ""no altercation of any kind"" involved in the teenage boy's death.Honduras' foreign minister, Eduardo Enrique Reina, wrote in a series of tweets Thursday night that his government ""regrets and offers its condolences for the death of the 17-year-old,"" whom he identified. The Honduran government ""is in contact with the family and has requested that ORR and HHS carry out an exhaustive investigation of the case... and, if there is any responsibility, apply the full weight of the law,"" he said, adding that the death ""underscores the importance of working together on the bilateral migration agenda on the situation of unaccompanied minors, to find solutions.""HHS said Friday that it ""is deeply saddened by this tragic loss and our heart goes out to the family, with whom we are in touch.""The ORR Division of Health for Unaccompanied Children ""is reviewing all clinical details of this case, including all inpatient healthcare records,"" which ""is standard practice for any situation involving the death of an unaccompanied child or a serious health outcome,"" HHS continued. ""A medical examiner investigation is underway. Due to privacy and safety reasons, ORR cannot share further information on individual cases of children who have been in our care."" \u201cAsked about the 17-year-old migrant child who died in U.S. custody in Florida, White House Press Sec. Karine Jean-Pierre says a medical investigation is underway:\n\n\u201cOur hearts go out to the family ... I haven\u2019t actually spoken to the president about this.\u201d\u201d — The Recount (@The Recount) 1683917903 The Tampa Bay Times reported that Bill Pellan, director of investigations for the District Six Medical Examiner Office, ""said further details of the boy's death could not be released due to the ongoing investigation"" while ""the Pinellas County Sheriff's Office confirmed the active case and declined to release records.""The newspaper also noted that the death ""is complicated by an ongoing dispute between the federal government and Gov. Ron DeSantis' administration, which in December 2021 announced that Florida will no longer license shelters that house migrant children.""DeSantis, a Republican expected to challenge former President Donald Trump for their party's 2024 presidential nomination, has gained national attention for his hostility toward migrants, from a widely condemned bill he signed into law on Wednesday to his role in flying South Americans to Martha's Vineyard last year.Although the DeSantis administration's shelter decision enables Florida facilities ""to operate without a license or state oversight,"" the Times explained Friday, HHS said that ORR still requires the sites to meet licensing standards and conducts its own monitoring and evaluation ""to ensure the safety and well-being of all children in our care.""The newly revealed deaths are rare, relative to the number of unaccompanied minors that enter the country. According to CBS: ""Over an eight-month span in 2018 and 2019, six children died in U.S. custody or shortly after being released, including a 10-year-old girl who died while in the care of ORR. Her death was the first of a child in U.S. custody since 2010, officials said at the time."" \u201cThis death of a migrant CHILD in federal custody always mattered to the public under Trump. Under this administration, it hardly registers. Shameful.\u201d — Aura Bogado (@Aura Bogado) 1683907979 Reporting on both Honduran children's deaths comes as the U.S. government rolls out controversial migrant policies in response to the expiration of Title 42, which was invoked by the administrations of both Trump and Democratic President Joe Biden to deport millions of asylum-seekers under the pretext of the Covid-19 pandemic.After Biden's policies were announced last month, the International Refugee Assistance Project said that it ""welcomes the expansion of family reunification parole programs and refugee processing in the Americas, but strongly opposes doing so as a trade-off for limiting the legal rights of people seeking asylum in the United States.""On Thursday, the ACLU, the civil liberties group's Northern California branch, the Center for Gender & Refugee Studies, and National Immigrant Justice Center filed a legal challenge to the asylum ban in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California.""The Biden administration's new ban places vulnerable asylum-seekers in grave danger and violates U.S. asylum laws.

803,DeSantis,2023-05-13,"""Did They Drill the Brother's Head? Who Will Be the Third One? Will It Be Me?""","The searing images, by ""the poster child for America's torture program,"" stun. ""Like clockwork,"" Abu Zubaydah was ceaselessly beaten, rectal-fed, hung by his hands, slammed into walls and waterboarded 83 times during Darth Cheney's grisly, senseless ""enhanced interrogation techniques."" In newly released drawings, Zubaydah documents his abuse during 21 years at Guantánamo. Still there, he's ""the forever prisoner"" - not for what he did (he was never charged) but for what was done to him.Now 52, the Saudi-born Zubaydah moved to the West Bank in occupied Palestine as a teenager, and was captured in Pakistan by CIA, FBI, and Pakistani agents in 2002. Shot multiple times, he was successively renditioned to CIA ""black sites"" in Pakistan, Poland, Thailand, Afghanistan, Lithuania and Northern Africa before being sent to Guantánamo in September 2006. There, he was used as ""a human guinea pig,"" the first victim of George Bush's ""21st-century medieval torture program"" against terror suspects. The US initially claimed he was a top al-Qaeda operative, but was later forced to concede he wasn't even a member of the group. ""Everybody agrees, they tortured the wrong guy,"" says his lawyer. ""They went ahead anyway so they could get permission to torture other people."" After years of savagery, roughly 120 victims and at least 26 detainee deaths at the hands of torturers at Asadadad, Bagram, Gardez, Abu Ghraib, Basra, Mosul, Tikrit, Bucca, CIA officials admitted they'd gained no new intelligence from the carnage. Zubaydah and his painfully detailed, precisely damning drawings, says attorney Mark Denbeaux, ""are the ultimate repudiation of the failure and abuses of torture."" They are also one of the few surviving records of a sordid post-9/11 chapter of history the CIA and FBI have long labored to keep hidden - and that current aspiring despot Ron DeSantis, sometimes laughingly complicit in it, has denied. Though the CIA made videotapes of Zubaydah's torture, they later destroyed them in violation of a court order; meanwhile, a 6,700-page report by a 2014 Senate intelligence committee remains secret. In the absence of any full accounting of a human rights disaster that violated both international laws and our government's own minimal guidelines, Zubaydah's drawings represent a singularly chilling look at this ""long-festering...collective national wound."" They saw new light this week when The Guardian published American Torturers: FBI and CIA Abuses at Dark Sites and Guantánamo, a report based on 40 sketches and Zubaydah's notes on them, compiled by Denbeaux, a law professor at Seton Hall University, a UC San Francisco psychiatry professor, and Seton Hall law students. ""Silence and darkness"" have kept Zubaydah imprisoned, argues Denbeaux; if the report's release, coupled with a new UN avowal that Zubaydah's ongoing detention is a crime against humanity, his ""iconic self-portraits (of torture) will have done their job.""Many of the portraits of his degradation between 2002 and 2006 are so meticulously rendered that Zubaydah often blacked out the faces of his torturers to protect their identities, and presumably himself. He depicts grotesque violence, sexual and religious humiliation, psychological terror, all accompanied by plain-spoken descriptions. ""This drawing shows threatening the detainee with rape,"" he writes of forced ""rectal feedings"" by guards wielding thick batons. They ""drop the prisoner on the ground, and hold him in a way to sodomize him""; they use ""dirty, sexual words,"" they ""start the disgrace,"" they ""use their hands or some sticks around the anus."" He draws himself chained naked before a female interrogator: He is ""sitting on the chair for weeks...Naked. Very hungry. Shivering from cold...He cannot cover his genitalia...They pour freezing buckets of water over him."" He describes prolonged use of multiple torture techniques he calls ""the Vortex"" of pain, stress, hunger and cold: Hitting with a stick in cold temperatures till the prisoner passes out, waking him up, starting on another method for an hour, pass out, wake up, more for the next hour, ""until they finish all their methods.""There is no respite, no break. He is regularly ""walled,"" thrown head-first against a concrete wall; beaten on his face and back; jammed into a tiny ""dog box"" for days; shackled for weeks; deprived of sleep; exposed to constant light and noise; threatened with desecration of the Qur’an; hung by his hands; forced into stress positions; denied use of a toilet to wallow in his own shit and piss. He is waterboarded 83 times; variations include being confined in a coffin-size crate that inexorably fills with water as he tries to keep his nose above it, leaving him terrified of drowning long afterward. The guards open the locked door of his cell when they bring a power drill into the next cell ""so I could hear the shouting, begging and crying in horror of the brother receiving the torture threat. Did they drill the brother's head? Did they drill his stomach or foot or rear end?...All these questions kept going through my mind for days until another day when they come back (with) the drill. The same sounds of horror come back...Is he the same brother? Didn't he die? Or is this another brother? Who is the second one? And who will be the third one? Will it be me?""

817,DeSantis,2023-05-14,"""Beware: Ron DeSantis' Attack on Voting Rights Won't Stay in Florida""","In an increasingly unsafe and, frankly, unhinged America, one of the things that keeps me up at night is the question of whether Governor Ron DeSantis’s far-right Florida will ultimately serve as a model for a national Republican Party in charge of the entire federal government. (Legislative and executive branches aside, of course no political party is technically supposed to control the ostensibly nonpartisan judicial branch. But we all know how that’s going.)The competition is stiff this year, with Idaho, Tennessee, and more recently (and somewhat surprisingly) Montana all making strong bids for the title. But how can anyone compete with a state governed by a man so rabidly “anti-woke” that he has declared war on Mickey Mouse, a major source of tourism dollars?I think it’s safe to say no state has surpassed Florida in the practical implementation of authoritarian governance, which DeSantis has pulled off with the help of both a rubber-stamp GOP supermajority in the state legislature and a peculiar knack for stacking the bureaucracy with right-wing Christian ideologues who have no qualms about imposing their hyper-partisan will in areas like healthcare and education.In his “war on woke,” DeSantis has shattered pre-existing norms, brazenly politicizing the Florida Board of Medicine as he attacked transgender Floridians and appointing Christopher Rufo – the right-wing activist who started the “critical race theory” panic – to the board of trustees of New College of Florida, a sometime quirky state liberal arts college known as a haven for queer Florida youth that is now being transformed into an ideologically driven indoctrination center.No state has surpassed Florida in the practical implementation of authoritarian governance, which DeSantis has pulled off with the help of both a rubber-stamp GOP supermajority in the state legislature and a peculiar knack for stacking the bureaucracy with right-wing Christian ideologuesJust last week, Florida passed two new authoritarian laws. One is a bathroom bill affecting schools, government buildings, prisons, and detention centers that imposes criminal “trespassing” charges on those who use a bathroom that does not correspond to their sex according to “chromosomes, naturally occurring sex hormones, and internal and external genitalia present at birth”. The other is a medical “conscience” bill that began as a way to protect healthcare practitioners opposed to public health mandates set during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, but that will also allow providers to refuse to provide treatment based on their personal beliefs, i.e. to discriminate against queer and especially trans people. And on top of that, for good measure, the Florida state senate passed a downright asinine resolution urging the United States Congress to stop the military from pursuing diversity initiatives and being too “woke” in matters of personnel.DeSantis touts his approach to Florida as a “blueprint” for remaking the United States, and there is no doubt the Republican base adores his penchant for political theatre and misusing government to “own the libs” and punish the marginalized.But more sophisticated Republicans – including key members of the all-important donor class – have begun to hesitate about backing DeSantis, worried (correctly) that his hard right social policies are alienating to independent voters, who trended Democrat in 2022 over abortion, leading to the underperforming of Republican candidates relative to historical tendencies. Some also accuse DeSantis of a lack of “people skills,” failing to return phone calls to donors and state legislators, and there is clearly a severe charisma gap between DeSantis and Donald Trump.Of course, DeSantis – still officially undeclared for the 2024 primaries but also Trump’s only serious competition for the Republican Party’s nomination for the presidency – need not be elected for a Republican president and Republican-controlled congress to try and implement much of what he has done in Florida. And one of his policies is particularly worrisome in that regard: his mobilization of an ‘Office of Election Crimes and Security’ – essentially a brand new sort of election police – to terrorize individuals whose votes were retroactively deemed illegal.As I’ve belaboured before, America’s political system is broken in ways that favour Republicans, who have also shown in recent years they will always choose power over democracy. Republicans have often been able to win the presidency while losing the popular vote for president in recent election cycles, because, through a system known as the Electoral College, the American system counts states’ ‘votes’ for president rather than individuals’, meaning that in most states, the votes of those in the minority end up having no impact on the presidential race. Where Republicans control state governments, they also engage in voter suppression and gerrymandering in order to give themselves unfair advantages. Republicans also regularly push a false narrative that America is wracked with widespread “voter fraud,” and it was this narrative that fueled the 6 January insurrection, which was centred on the bald-faced lie that then president-elect Joe Biden had somehow “stolen” the election from Trump.Oddly enough, the 2018 Florida gubernatorial election in which DeSantis beat Democratic challenger Andrew Gillum was affected by voter suppression, but it also saw the passage of a state constitutional amendment widely touted as a win for democracy: the re-enfranchisement of convicted felons who have completed their sentences, including parole or probation. Previously, Florida banned all convicted felons from voting. After 2018, those restrictions were lifted except for those convicted of murder or sexual crimes. And this is where things get messy.Between their founding in April 2022 and January 2023, DeSantis’s election police made a total of 24 arrests of people who had voted illegally, but almost certainly without the intent to do so, in the 2020 election – an election in which over 11 million Floridians voted. In at least some cases these rehabilitated felons were issued voter cards by the state, which is an obvious indication that they voted in good faith, and that, if anyone is liable for the error, it should be the Florida state government. Nevertheless, out of the blue, DeSantis sent in his shiny new force to disrupt and destroy the lives they had rebuilt. Despite the fact that these election police clearly have almost nothing to do, DeSantis and the state legislature have moved to increase their budget.Some of these arrests led to plea deals that resulted in no jail time, while six have been dismissed by the courts, according to reporting by Lori Rosza for The Washington Post. DeSantis and his supporters presumably want convictions, since gratuitous cruelty is a hallmark of fascist politics – and indeed, the state legislature has obligingly moved to give the statewide prosecutor jurisdiction over ‘voter fraud’ cases in order to stop courts from dismissing cases on jurisdictional grounds, as several have done to date. But the arrests need not result in convictions for the possibility of being arrested for voting to have a deterrent effect among e.g. African-American communities – precisely the kinds of communities whose voting Republicans seek to suppress.Rosza’s reporting covers the case of Peter Washington, who was issued a voter ID card before he went to cast his vote for Biden. Per Rosza’s description, Washington “knows now he can’t vote – unless he applies for and receives clemency – but he’s telling others they should be wary of it, too, even if they don’t have a criminal record. One of his adult children has already decided he won’t be casting a ballot. A friend is doubting it, too.”Thinking nationally again, with respect to 2024 and beyond, the possibility that a future Republican president might create a national voting police force is terrifying. The fiction of a ‘voter fraud’ crisis Republicans already use to mobilise voters and stir up fear and outrage is plenty damaging; 6 January amply illustrates that point. But imagine the creation of federal machinery to enforce that phoney narrative through state terror, and the impact that would have on voting throughout the United States. It may seem far-fetched, but DeSantis is already engaging in state terror in Florida. And if Republicans had to worry less about their base’s preferred culture wars policies alienating voters, the donor class would have little incentive to shy away from culture warriors like DeSantis. And that’s what really keeps me up at night.",Common Dreams,Business,Yes,20.643577771146653,99.0615294172297,85.29337610012907,30.86466224317519,70.11979106345238,88.71828987073341,ron desantis,{},"{'government': 'federal', 'branches': 'legislative', 'party': 'political', 'branch': 'judicial', 'bids': 'strong', 'source': 'major', 'implementation': 'practical', 'governance': 'authoritarian', 'knack': 'peculiar', 'wing': 'right', 'ideologues': 'christian', 'will': 'partisan', 'norms': 'existing', 'activist': 'wing', 'theory': 'critical', 'college': 'quirky', 'arts': 'liberal', 'youth': 'queer', 'center': 'driven', 'week': 'last', 'laws': 'authoritarian', 'charges': 'criminal', 'genitalia': 'internal', 'bill': 'medical', 'health': 'public', 'beliefs': 'personal', 'measure': 'good', 'resolution': 'asinine', 'base': 'republican', 'theatre': 'political', 'members': 'key', 'class': 'important', 'policies': 'social', 'voters': 'independent', 'candidates': 'relative', 'tendencies': 'historical', 'gap': 'severe', 'competition': 'serious', 'president': 'republican', 'sort': 'new', 'system': 'american', 'years': 'recent', 'vote': 'popular', 'cycles': 'recent', 'states': 'most', 'race': 'presidential', 'advantages': 'unfair', 'narrative': 'false', 'fraud': 'widespread', 'lie': 'faced', 'election': 'gubernatorial', 'challenger': 'democratic', 'amendment': 'constitutional', 'felons': 'rehabilitated', 'crimes': 'sexual', 'indication': 'obvious', 'faith': 'good', 'force': 'national', 'cruelty': 'gratuitous', 'politics': 'fascist', 'jurisdiction': 'statewide', 'grounds': 'jurisdictional', 'communities': 'american', 'record': 'criminal', 'machinery': 'federal', 'wars': 'preferred', 'incentive': 'little'}",0,1

856,DeSantis,2023-05-17,"""And They're Off: GOP Sets Bar So Low and Weird It's Underground and Babbling About Mermaids""","Hoo boy. The GOP primary season got off to a bonkers start in first-in-the-nation Iowa, where smarmy Li'l Ron wowed by keeping his big-boy pants on and taking timid digs at he-who-shall-not-be-named, in absentia 'cause a non-tornado might've mussed his hair. They were joined by a ragtag band of bigots, felons, liars, crackpots, fascists and charlatans - Pastors For Trump! Missing Informants! Seductive Seducing Spirits! - who make Kesey's trippy Merry Pranksters look like Lutheran astrophysicists. Oh, democracy.For anyone who continues to argue there's no difference between today's lunatic, deeply malevolent GOP and an admittedly flawed but largely lucid Democratic Party, look no further than the rancor, bombast, delusion and deceit on squalid display in Iowa and environs last weekend as the GOP's alleged presidential contenders and their supporters flaunted their White Christian Nationalist cred against demonic empathy. With multiple state and local elections starting - and yes, they matter - national Republican players are busy jockeying for position and issuing their positions on the most vital issues of the day. Mo Brooks is freaking out that new cars will no longer have AM radio, ""one of few places you can find honest news and thought. As for me, I will not buy a new BMW, Tesla, Ford, Volkswagen, Mazda or any other AM radio-less car the rest of my life!"" Matt Schlapp is ranting the scanners and credit card machines at Reagan National Airport are down and, ""We need to make America work again."" Gym Jordan is whining a much-touted immigration surge didn't arrive and yet Biden ""vacations at his beach house while our border patrol works overtime to stop the chaos he caused at the southern border.""And poor House Oversight Chairman James Comer, hungry to uncover the nefarious wrongdoings of ""the Biden crime family,"" has up and lost his ""very credible"" informants/whistleblowers - ""It could happen to anyone"" - though it's unclear if he's looked under his couch cushions. In a terrifyingly stupid exchange with Fox' Maria Bartiromo, she asked, ""Where is that informant today?"" and he said he can't find them. She, eyes wide: ""Hold on a second, Congressman, did you just say the whistleblower or the informant is now missing?!"" He: ""Well, we're hopeful we can find the informant,"" helpfully adding they're ""in the ""spy business"" and ""they don't make a habit of being seen a lot."" His 89-year-old cohort Chuck Grassley, trying not to panic, has demanded the DOJ hand over a 2020 document he's sure will nail Biden for his ""criminal scheme""; a day later, he conceded of those ""very serious allegations"" that, ""I wish I could say I knew it was true or untrue."" Still, having ""lost"" most of their informants - ""They're in court or in jail or we can't talk with them at this time"" - Marjorie Taylor Greene remains confident ""this is a very real situation (that) will bring down the president of the United States,"" and she'll throw in a bridge, too.But the weekend's action focused on Iowa, where ""manly pugilists"" Trump and DeSantis were for the first time scheduled to face off in the same place. The expected confrontation evaporated after Trump cancelled his Des Moines rally due to tornado warnings - when a downpour quickly cleared, his campaign posted a video anyway to make him seem less wussy - so DeSantis' ""War Room"" getting the field and oxygen to himself prompted a frantic media presence. ""And they're off!"" declared Heather Digby Parton, who then observed, ""We are in for some very silly coverage of this primary."" Even apart from his loathsome bigotry, authoritarianism and fear-mongering, ""Discount Donald"" is famously unlikable: He's often portrayed as an arrogant, aloof, crude guy with a ""humanoid problem"" so serious he struggles to make small talk and eye contact. He's also short - reportedly a Napoleonic 5'9"" - though he wears cowboy boots to camouflage it. Newly trim in jeans, hair slicked back, standing ram-rod straight, he looks more than ever like the Little Mussolini of his ugly dreams. Still, the bar keeps dropping lower: Despite the negatives - a rude puny fascist - he nonetheless got bizarrely fawning coverage. He walks! He talks! He chews gum!Following their reprehensible, both-sides slide to the right, the New York Times proclaimed DeSantis ""awkward but still winning the crowd"" under a headline, ""Impresses Voters, Trolls Trump."" They called it ""a big win"" - he ""essentially kicked sand in the former president's face"" - when he made a brave, macho man, unscheduled stop in Des Moines, where Trump would have been if he'd shown up, except he didn't. In fact, DeSantis was so fearful of causing offense he literally didn't say Trump's name, resorting in a milquetoast speech to vague references to ""a bold agenda"" (aka fascism), the need to reject ""focusing on the past"" and ""the culture of losing that has infected our party in recent years,” and the fact that, ""at the end of the day, governing is not about entertaining, building a brand or talking on social media"" (but, again, fascism). Politico cited his feeble achievements: ""He did an adequate job at retail politics"" - shook hands, talked up as ""legit"" a favorite local pizza, flipped burgers long enough for a photo - got ""face time (with) GOP brass"" and ""drew a contrast with Trump, albeit implicitly."" In the end, ""His message seemed to resonate""; then again, people had paid to hear him, so duh.DeSantis did well enough in a famously quixotic state that, on the op-ed page of the Des Moines Register, local GOP leaders endorsed his ""record and resolve."" Still, that endorsement could prove pretty wobbly. Long touted as a more reasonable, less toxic alternative to Trump, DeSantis has reportedly lost money and support with his totalitarian moves - forced birthing, war on Disney, no books or sex or history. Also, the whole ""Trump without the baggage"" claim gets pretty pathetic when you remember that Trump is a twice-impeached, criminally indicted sex offender, narcissist and loser who remains under multiple investigations, so he kinda is the baggage. Responses to DeSantis' less-than-electrifying claim he offers ""a positive alternative for the future of this country"" ran the gamut: From ""this is what leadership looks like"" and ""the room was electric"" to ""sooo boring"" to ""Ron DeFailure is a very small man, not just in height"" to ""Nazi"" to ""So, just ignore the past Democrats' communist subversion?"" Then again, over these last pained years it seems even some Republicans have learned it could always be worse. From one attendee, ""I would vote for a shoe over Trump"" - a bar even DeSantis clears.Meanwhile, in Des Moines, a small crowd of MAGA diehards got caught in ""a muddy, wet nightmare"" waiting in vain for their sad savior. ""But everyone is saying when he comes back, it’ll be bigger and better,"" chirped one GOP organizer. ""You know Trump."" Meanwhile, the lowest of the low was safely ensconced at Mar-A-Lago, where he was again violating trademark laws - also burning eyelids, and yes we're linking to TMZ - by ""dancing"" to a poolside Macho Man performance by a fake Village People. Don't ask. Still, he took time out to call fans at a ReAwaken America Tour, the traveling MAGA circus and theocratic roadshow featuring convicted felon and fascist crank Mike Flynn, ""an unhinged band of shofar-bleaters, conspiracy theorists and zealots"" like the demon sperm lady, and usually a few Nazis unless, as in this case, Rachel Maddow outs them - astonishingly, just one of two messianic events held last weekend at his Doral resort.To ecstatic scrams from the crowd, Trump called Flynn - ""He's some general, he's some man"" - to promise he'll return him to the White House. Also Stephen Miller for Homeland Security! Kid Rock as Secretary of State! ""You just stay wealthy,"" he told Flynn, ""and healthy and well and everything. We're bringing you back!""Improbably, that was tame compared to the charismatic, bellicose Pastors For Trump, which views Trump 2024 as ""a gift from the Lord"" at a time when “Satan (has) an entire political party in this nation doing his bidding"" - they may have a point there - in ""the battle between good and evil."" ""The removal of The Biden is coming,"" declared Julie Green of our observant Catholic president. “That’s what the Lord is saying.” According to ""prophet"" Amanda Grace, the Lord is also saying, ""There's wickedness attempting to completely cover this nation in perversion and seductive seducing spirits."" Grace told the rapt crowd she's ""never seen more images of mermaids and water people in my life,"" and they are ""highly technologically advanced."" ""We have to understand the rules of engagement in spiritual warfare,"" she said. ""We are meant for hand-to-hand combat...to bring our cries before the throne of God to bring judgment on the rulers of darkness."" In other words, they really don't seem to like the new live-action The Little Mermaid, which features, scandalously, a black Ariel. It's scheduled to open in theaters in about a week, but we're sure Benito DeSantis can ban, belittle, censor, malign, overrule, lie about or find a positive alternative to it before then.

891,DeSantis,2023-05-18,"""Disney Cancels Plans For $1 Billion Florida Expansion Amid Fight With DeSantis""","Media giant Disney has canceled plans to create a $1 billion office park in Florida that the company estimated would have brought 2,000 jobs to the state amid its fight with governor Ron DeSantis. Disney CEO Bob Iger said on an earnings call recently that, in fighting Disney, DeSantis was potentially jeopardizing further investment from the House of Mouse. And on Thursday, the company showed that it was not bluffing.The Florida project, known as Lake Nona Town Center, would have included a massive new complex. 1,000 workers from Disney's Southern California offices were due to relocate, and a further 1,000 would join to work on Imagineering projects.Some workers complained and threatened to quit over the prospect of being relocated (and some 200 reportedly already relocated). Disney pressed ahead, though, in part due to a Florida tax credit and the belief that Florida was a good place to do business.Disney boss Josh D'Amaro said in an email obtained by The New York Times that ""changing business conditions"" led Disney to scuttle its plans for a new office in Florida. Although this new office park is not going ahead, Disney said it will still invest $17 billion in Florida over the next decade at its Disney World park that could create 13,000 jobs.Sources told NYT that Disney's public battle against DeSantis ""figured prominently"" in the decision to cancel the Lake Nona Town Center project. Disney workers who already moved from California to Florida will have meetings to discuss next steps, including the potential to move back.The fight with DeSantis might not be the only reason Disney is canceling the Lake Nona Town Center. NYT reported that when Iger returned to Disney to become CEO again, he told his reports that it didn't make sense to shift Imagineering so far away from Disney's movie studios in California.This is all happening as Disney attempts to cut $5.5 billion costs through a number of means, including laying off some 7,000 workers. Disney isn't shrinking its workforce entirely, though, as the company just signed The Pat McAfee show to a lucrative deal. Disney is suing DeSantis in part because the company believes DeSantis is trying to strip away Disney's special Reedy Creek district as a means of retaliation for Disney's opposition to the ""Don't Say Gay"" legislation in Florida.""This is about one thing and one thing only, and that's retaliating against us for taking a position about pending legislation. And we believe that in us taking that position, we are merely exercising our right to free speech. Also, this is not about special privileges or a level playing field or Disney in any way using its leverage around the state of Florida,"" Iger said.DeSantis is seeking to remove Disney's ""special district"" status in Orlando. Walt Disney himself convinced Florida legislators back in the '60s to give him a special district allowing the company to act semi-autonomously on its grounds when the entertainment legend was establishing EPCOT as a real city of the future. The city never panned out. But the Reedy Creek district and special status remained, and Disney has benefitted in a business sense for decades.Iger pointed out that Florida has more than 2,000 of these special districts--the Daytona Motor Speedway being one of them. These special districts have allowed Disney and others to benefit financially by making it easier to do business. Iger said he recognizes this has been a beneficial thing for Disney, but he also pointed out that Disney's parks in Florida employ over 75,000 people and attract ""tens of millions"" of people to Florida.This case is far from over, so keep checking back with GameSpot for more.",Gamespot,Entertainment,Yes,18.94550416755885,99.86269662725452,99.98938542568855,23.24494573510257,84.92945768371096,73.50136261765212,disney cancels,{},"{'investment': 'further', 'complex': 'new', 'projects': 'imagineering', 'place': 'good', 'office': 'new', 'park': 'new', 'decade': 'next', 'battle': 'public', 'steps': 'next', 'reason': 'only', 'deal': 'lucrative', 'district': 'special', 'legislation': 'pending', 'speech': 'free', 'privileges': 'special', 'field': 'level', 'city': 'real', 'status': 'special', 'districts': 'special', 'thing': 'beneficial'}",0,1

903,DeSantis,2023-05-19,"""Florida Enacts Anti-ESG Legislation – House Bill 3 Explained""","Accelerate ESG On May 2, 2023, Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-FL) signed into law House Bill 3 (HB3), legislation that, among other things, blocks the consideration of environmental, social and governance (ESG) factors in state and local investment decisions and procurement processes. As we have written about previously (e.g., here), the politicization of ESG is creating significant complexities for companies that do business in multiple jurisdictions, some of which require or permit the consideration of ESG factors, and others that have adopted anti-ESG legislation similar to HB3. That said, HB3, which is scheduled to take effect on July 1, 2023, is considered among the farthest reaching anti-ESG legislative enactments to date. The following alert describes HB3’s requirements. At a high-level, HB3 requires that investment decisions (and proxy voting decisions) for state pension assets be made taking into account only “pecuniary factors.” For purposes of the legislation, “pecuniary factors” are defined as factors that are “expected to have a material effect on the risk or returns of an investment based on appropriate investment horizons consistent with applicable investment objectives and funding policy.” Importantly, the term prohibits “the consideration of…any social, political or ideological interests” when state and local officials make investment and other covered decisions. Notably, in addition to applying to investment decisions relative to state pension assets, among other things, HB3 also places limits on investment decisions for local governments; prohibits the issuance of ESG bonds in Florida; and imposes limits on state procurement processes. More specifically: Managers of Florida’s state pension assets can only take into account pecuniary factors when evaluating investment opportunities and cannot consider any non-pecuniary factors (i.e., ESG principles) when making these investment decisions. Similarly, the Florida Chief Financial Officer, which is an elected position, may only consider pecuniary factors when making investment decisions. Furthermore, the law requires certain investment managers and advisers to provide an annual written certification stating that investment decisions are based solely on pecuniary factors. Failure to timely file the certification may lead to termination of certain contracts between the investing entity and the investment manager/adviser. A materially false certification is deemed a willful refusal to comply with the investment manager’s or adviser’s fiduciary standard. In each case, failure to comply with this certification requirement may give rise to civil or administrative action by the Florida Attorney General. Relatedly, when determining how to exercise shareholder rights (e.g., proxy voting decisions), public fund managers may only consider pecuniary factors in making such determinations; non-pecuniary factors may not be considered. The statute also imposes annual reporting requirements on such managers relative to shareholder voting decisions, providing assurances with respect to discharging duties consistent with HB3’s requirements and governance policies. Under HB3, local governments are prohibited from considering any ESG principles when making any investment decisions. All such decisions must be made solely on the basis of pecuniary factors. With respect to procurement processes, state and local officials may no longer consider ESG factors when awarding government contracts and HB3 expressly prohibits favoring any vendors on the basis of such factors. HB3 redefines the term “qualified public depository” (i.e., institutions that can accept and hold Floridian deposit funds) to include only those institutions that invest deposited funds solely on the basis of pecuniary factors. Relatedly, under HB3, these institutions cannot deny services on the basis of failing to satisfy certain ESG-related goals (e.g., net-zero emissions targets or diversity, equity and inclusion (DEI)-related goals in the boardroom). HB3 makes it an “unsafe and unsound practice” for financial institutions to “deny or cancel its services to a person, or to otherwise discriminate against a person when making available such services or in the terms or conditions of such services” on the basis of a person’s political opinions, speech or affiliations; religious beliefs or affiliations; any factor that is not “quantitative, impartial, and risk-based”; or the use of any “rating, scoring, analysis, tabulation, or action that considers a social credit score.” Some reports have interpreted this new provision to mean that financial institutions cannot prohibit extensions of credit to certain industries (e.g., traditional energy companies and gun manufacturers). HB3 prohibits the issuance by the state or any municipality of ESG bonds (i.e., bonds that are issued with a particular ESG goal or ESG-related purpose). Relatedly, HB3 prohibits the state and local governments from entering into contracts with any rating agency that could issue an ESG-related rating that adversely affects the bond rating of a particular issuer.  Pursuant to HB3, when governmental entities enter into contracts with private investment managers, such contracts must include a provision governing written communications between such investment managers and a company in which such investment manager invests public funds on behalf of the governmental entity. Specifically, to the extent such written communications discuss “social, political, or ideological interests”; subordinates the interests of the company’s shareholders to the interests of another entity; or advocates for any party other than the company’s shareholders, then such communication must include a conspicuous disclaimer reading “[T]he views and opinions expressed in this communication are those of the sender and do not reflect the views and opinions of the people of the State of Florida.”   HB3 is part of a larger effort by some who question the efficacy of using ESG factors in making investment decisions, developing financial products and in relation to corporate strategic decision making. Indeed, in March, Gov. DeSantis and 17 other governors announced the formation of an “alliance” that aims to “protect individuals from the ESG movement,” including prohibiting the consideration of ESG factors when state and local governments are making investment decisions. This alliance is consistent with other efforts to “blacklist” major asset managers that are known for taking ESG risk factors into consideration when making investment decisions. For instance, Oklahoma became the latest state to warn certain major financial institutions of potential divestiture based on their deemed boycotting of fossil fuels by including them on their initial list of “Restricted Financial Companies.” Relatedly, you will recall that President Biden recently vetoed an effort by congressional Republicans to prevent pension fund managers from using ESG factors when making investment decisions. That legislation related to a final rule published by the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) (which we wrote about here) that permits plan fiduciaries to consider ESG factors when evaluating investments. Meanwhile, according to a recent report from S&P Global Ratings, sustainable municipal bond issuances during the first quarter of 2023 grew by 13% year over year, to $8.96 billion. HB3’s requirements will undoubtedly raise complex questions in terms of whether certain investment processes and procedures are implicated by the legislation. Because the analysis of any particular scenario will vary based on relevant facts and circumstances, we encourage you to consult with counsel in relation to any questions you may have relative to complying with HB3. ",Akin,Top,Yes,18.914309233407128,21.326612338412087,99.257087136591,23.10496561043548,68.95141539892805,81.8834734363265,florida enacts,{},"{'things': 'other', 'factors': 'pecuniary', 'complexities': 'significant', 'jurisdictions': 'multiple', 'legislation': 'similar', 'enactments': 'legislative', 'alert': 'following', 'level': 'high', 'decisions': 'such', 'effect': 'material', 'horizons': 'consistent', 'objectives': 'applicable', 'interests': 'social', 'governments': 'local', 'position': 'elected', 'managers': 'major', 'certification': 'false', 'contracts': 'such', 'refusal': 'willful', 'standard': 'fiduciary', 'action': 'civil', 'fund': 'public', 'determinations': 'such', 'requirements': 'annual', 'depository': 'public', 'funds': 'public', 'goals': 'dei)-related', 'practice': 'unsafe', 'institutions': 'financial', 'services': 'such', 'opinions': 'political', 'beliefs': 'religious', 'credit': 'social', 'provision': 'new', 'industries': 'certain', 'companies': 'traditional', 'goal': 'particular', 'purpose': 'related', 'rating': 'related', 'issuer': 'particular', 'entities': 'governmental', 'communications': 'written', 'manager': 'such', 'entity': 'governmental', 'party': 'other', 'communication': 'such', 'disclaimer': 'conspicuous', 'views': 't]he', 'effort': 'larger', 'products': 'financial', 'making': 'corporate', 'decision': 'strategic', 'governors': 'other', 'efforts': 'other', 'state': 'latest', 'divestiture': 'potential', 'boycotting': 'deemed', 'fuels': 'fossil', 'list': 'initial', 'rule': 'final', 'report': 'recent', 'issuances': 'sustainable', 'bond': 'municipal', 'quarter': 'first', 'questions': 'complex', 'processes': 'certain', 'scenario': 'particular', 'facts': 'relevant'}",0,0

Ron DeSantis is on the precipice of officially launching a presidential campaign. From his recent trips to crucial states like New Hampshire and Iowa, to the usual international trip undertaken by potential presidents, a quest for the highest office in the land is on the horizon for DeSantis.There are those who contend his candidacy embodies a new fresh face within the Republican Party. DeSantis critiques modern culture with the now popular (and notorious) term “woke” and laments about the tyranny of “cancel culture.” He is locked into the day-to-day national news story outside of traditional electoral politics.For example, he joined online conservatives rallying against Bud Light for collaborating with a trans social media influencer for a fun marketing campaign. DeSantis’ team then posted a vicious video mocking trans athletes, and the governor shared in an interview he’d never drink Bud Light again.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,Yes,19.82266012622891,98.19206876584704,98.36620233668523,27.180982267506582,52.34463850015492,59.19772207931603,ron desantis,{},"{'campaign': 'presidential', 'trips': 'recent', 'states': 'crucial', 'trip': 'international', 'presidents': 'potential', 'office': 'highest', 'face': 'fresh', 'culture': 'modern', 'term': 'notorious', 'politics': 'electoral', 'conservatives': 'online', 'influencer': 'trans', 'media': 'social', 'athletes': 'vicious'}",1,0

The notice warns that the Sunshine State is now “openly hostile toward African Americans, people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals.”“Before traveling to Florida, please understand that the state of Florida devalues and marginalizes the contributions of, and the challenges faced by African Americans and other communities of color,” the statement said.Read more at The Daily Beast.Got a tip?

962,DeSantis,2023-05-22,"""Stand Up America Statement on Senator Tim Scott's Presidential Announcement""","Today, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) announced he will run for president in 2024. Scott enters the Republican primary against indicted former president Donald Trump and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. The candidates will reportedly be joined by fellow MAGA extremist and Trump understudy Ron DeSantis, who is expected to announce his candidacy in the coming days. Stand Up America’s spokesperson, Sarah Harris, issued the following statement:“Tim Scott has tried to cultivate the image of a Republican who stays above the MAGA fray, but his voting record says otherwise. From championing tax giveaways to the richest Americans and corporations to opposing federal legislation to protect voting rights, Scott has built his career voting against the interests of everyday Americans in South Carolina and across the country. “As we look ahead to the 2024 election, it’s critical that voters understand that the current roster of GOP candidates for president––Trump, Haley, DeSantis, and Scott––are all MAGA extremists who are a threat to our democracy and our freedoms. We must do everything in our power to ensure they are not sent to the Oval Office in 2025.”Scott has long been a champion for right-wing causes. As Senator, Scott has voted in lockstep with the MAGA agenda – opposing key legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act for gun safety legislation. Scott has also been a vocal supporter of tax cuts for billionaires and federal limits on reproductive justice. Despite his “moderate” persona, he remains a strong ally of Donald Trump and continues to perpetuate MAGA misinformation and vote against the interests of the American people. Stand Up America was founded in 2016 as a digital-first grassroots community working to resist Donald Trump and his cronies’ corruption, racism, and his threats to our democracy. From 2017 to 2021, our members made 1.7 million calls to Congress to oppose the MAGA extremist agenda. In 2020, our volunteers contacted 25 million voters to help defeat Trump and elect Joe Biden to the presidency. During the 2022 midterms, our team helped build a firewall for democracy ahead of 2024 by electing pro-democracy Secretaries of State in Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota, and Nevada, passing key democracy ballot initiatives, and mobilizing our members to get out the vote for progressive candidates nationwide. In 2024, our community will continue mobilizing to elect candidates who will stand up for our freedoms and our democracy.",Common Dreams,Business,No,19.95042345164405,77.37498831225636,91.64122548003516,27.754290937834572,63.20696194587675,61.477116586972215,america statement,{},"{'primary': 'republican', 'president': 'former', 'extremist': 'fellow', 'days': 'coming', 'legislation': 'key', 'roster': 'current', 'wing': 'right', 'causes': 'wing', 'supporter': 'vocal', 'limits': 'federal', 'justice': 'reproductive', 'persona': 'moderate', 'ally': 'strong', 'people': 'american', 'community': 'grassroots', 'agenda': 'extremist', 'initiatives': 'key', 'candidates': 'progressive'}",1,1

DeSantis will launch his presidential bid in a conversation with Tesla CEO Elon Musk. Musk recently stepped down as the Twitter CEO but will host the event on Twitter Spaces.Elon Musk and Ron DeSantis, the Governor of Florida, are figures who often challenge conventional political and regulatory norms. Musk public statements generally advocate for less regulation, free speech, and more personal and business freedoms. On the other hand, Ron DeSantis, a Republican, has advocated for conservative principles and policies throughout his political career. He, too, has sometimes challenged conventional norms, particularly in his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Over the last year, DeSantis has been in a battle with Disney, one of Florida's largest employers, largely over legislation signed by DeSantis, known as the Parental Rights in Education Act or the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill. This law limits discussion about sexual orientation and gender identity in certain elementary school grades, a move which Disney criticized publicly. DeSantis initiated moves to limit Disney World's special tax status and its autonomy. While Disney managed to retain its special tax district, control of the tax district's five-member oversight board was transferred to DeSantis. The conflict has escalated to a lawsuit, with Disney suing DeSantis and the board for voting to nullify agreements giving Disney control over expansion at the complex. Disney alleges it was subjected to a ""targeted campaign of government retaliation"". As a result, Disney has halted a $1 billion office complex construction project in Orlando, demonstrating the potential economic implications of the conflict. This dispute reflects the increasingly partisan battles corporations are facing.While Musk and DeSantis specific political ideologies might not perfectly align, they share a commonality of challenging established practices and advocating for their vision, albeit in different arenas. DeSantis will not be doing the announcement at Disney World and Bob Iger is not on the invite list.

1011,DeSantis,2023-05-24,"""The JPY is the strongest and the NZD is the weakest as the NA session begins""","The JPY is the strongest and the NZD is the run-away weakest of the majors as the North American session begins. The NZD has tumbled lower after the RBNZ raised rates by 25 basis points, with debate between unchanged and a 25 basis point hike (the vote was 5-2 for the hike). The USD is higher with most of the gains coming vs the NZD, but there was also flight to safety flows into the relative safety of the USD and the JPY vs other currencies. The stalemate over the U.S. debt ceiling continues to raise fears in the markets of a potential default, as another round of unproductive talks between representatives of President Biden and House Speaker McCarthy took place over the $31.4 trillion debt limit. This political gridlock and imminent fiscal crisis cast a shadow over Wall Street, causing U.S. stock futures to slump overnight (Europe stocks are lower helped by higher inflation in the UK as well), further rattling an already anxious global market. Later today, investors will be eagerly awaiting the release of the Federal Reserve's meeting minutes for hints about the future interest rate path. As policymakers continue their debates over the possible halting of the rate-rising cycle, attention is also being drawn toward Ron DeSantis' impending announcement of his 2024 presidential bid during a Twitter conversation with Elon Musk. Additionally, concerns over tightening supply conditions boosted crude oil prices, fueled by industry data showing a steep drop in U.S. inventories (draw of -6.799M barrels vs expectations of a small build of 0.775M est. for inventories today), and speculation that OPEC and its allies may cut production in June. US yields are lower at the further end of the yield curve (by a couple of basis points), while the 2 year yield is unchanged. Traders are torn between flight to safety flows, and concerns about less demand as a result of default risk increasing as Washington battles. The White House and GOP negotiators are set to resume debt talks this morning. Stay tuned.In overnight developments in the Asian Pacific session, the Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) raised rates by 25 basis points to 5.5%. In their statement, they committed to maintaining restrictive interest rates for the foreseeable future to ensure a return to the 1-3% annual inflation target range, while also supporting maximum sustainable employment. This decision comes in response to weak global economic growth, easing inflation pressures, and easing supply chain constraints. New Zealand's inflation is anticipated to decline from its peak, but core inflation pressures will persist until capacity constraints lessen further. Despite employment being above its maximum sustainable level, labor shortages are reportedly easing. Consumer spending growth and residential construction activity have declined, while businesses report a decrease in demand for their goods and services. The reopening of international borders has led to an influx of immigration, which is expected to ease back to pre-COVID-19 levels, contributing to the uncertainty of its net impact on overall spending. However, the recovery in tourism spending and the rebuilding efforts in the North Island due to severe weather events are expected to support economic activity. In his press conference, RBNZ Governor Adrian Orr indicated satisfaction with the latest data, recognizing the long journey the bank has navigated in its decision-making. In a first, the monetary policy committee moved to a vote over the policy decision, a signal of potential divergent views. The vote was 5-2 in favor of the hike (2 voted for unchanged). Orr also highlighted that the outlook for fiscal spending appears to be contractionary on demand, implying that less government spending could dampen economic activity. He further stated that the Reserve Bank of New Zealand expects to maintain a restrictive monetary policy for a while, suggesting that interest rates could remain high to contain inflation. Orr also forecasted that the surge in immigration will ease, which could have implications for the labor market and overall economic growth. Shifting labor market dynamics were also underscored, with Orr noting that the issue was no longer about labor shortages, but rather about demand shortages. These sentiments were echoed by RBNZ Chief Economist Conway, who also remarked that pressure in the labor market is easing. Overall, the comments reflect a cautious approach by the RBNZ as it navigates evolving economic conditions.In today's European session, significant data was released pertaining to both the British pound (GBP) and the euro (EUR). In the UK, inflation rates exceeded expectations, with year-on-year Consumer Price Index (CPI) at 8.7%, against a forecast of 8.2% and a previous of 10.1%. Core CPI, which excludes volatile goods such as energy and food, also rose more than expected at 6.8% y/y (vs 6.2% est). The Retail Price Index (RPI) year-on-year likewise outpaced forecasts, hitting 11.4% against the anticipated 11.1%. In terms of producer prices, the Producer Price Index (PPI) Input came in below expectations at -0.3% on a monthly basis, while PPI Output was flat at 0.0%. The House Price Index (HPI) y/y revealed an increase in UK housing prices by 4.1%, lower than the 5.2% forecast.For the Eurozone, specifically Germany, the ifo Business Climate Index slightly underperformed against expectations, reporting a value of 91.7 compared to the predicted 93.0. The index is an important economic indicator for the German economy as it reflects the current sentiment among German businesses. This underperformance indicates that German businesses are less optimistic about the current business climate than anticipated. Overall, today's session revealed inflationary pressures in the UK and a somewhat subdued business climate in Germany.A snapshot of the market's are showing:Crude oil is trading up $1.221 or 1.20% at $74.12Gold prices are up $7 or 0.35% at $1981.73Silver is unchanged at $23.43Bitcoin is trading down at $26,733.

1026,DeSantis,2023-05-24,"""This a test""","Jordan Neely was a (black) ""normal nerdy kid"" who loved street performing as Michael Jackson; after he ""lost it"" from seeing his mother murdered, he became an unhoused, under-served, mentally ill man whose distress one day was so discomfiting that (big, white) Daniel Penny - who ""love(s) all people"" - saw fit to choke him to death on the floor of a subway car. In a stand-your-ground country of fear and rage and self-appointed judge, jury and executioner, thus do we become ""a people without empathy."" Former Marine Daniel Penny, 24, encountered Neely, 30, on May 1 on a Manhattan uptown F train. Penny, a blond, buff, six-foot-one surfer, was headed to his gym. In the same car Neely, reportedly distraught, threw his jacket to the floor and began ""screaming for help,"" yelling to the car's passengers that he was thirsty, hungry, fed up, ready to die. Perturbed that a homeless, hapless black man was experiencing a mental health crisis near him, Penny came up from behind and put Neely in what the military calls a ""rear-naked blood choke,"" which cuts oxygen-enriched blood by squeezing the carotid arteries in the neck. The attack was filmed by independent journalist Juan Alberto Vazquez, also on the train; his video, which quickly went viral, only lasts a few minutes. But various witnesses said Penny, helped by two men holding Neely down, kept choking him for between 7 and 15 minutes as his arms and legs desperately flailed and his body slowly went limp. A Marine training manual states an ""aggressor"" in a blood choke will lose consciousness in 8 to 13 seconds, so tell us what part of ""excessive use of force"" you don't understand. After Neely's death, police questioned Penny and released him; on May 12, once the medical examiner ruled Neely's death a homicide caused by ""compression of neck,"" they charged Penny with second-degree manslaughter. He is free on $100,000 bail. The killing sparked raucous protests and debate about racism, homelessness and vigilantism in a city where last year over 815 homeless people died - at least 15 killed in random violence - and rates of homelessness and untreated mental illness continue to soar. There was fury Penny, a white man, wasn't initially charged, when we all know ""Barack freaking Obama would not be allowed to walk away after choking a homeless white man to death on the subway."" Neely's family denounced the lesser charge of manslaughter vs. murder - isn't that ""homicide,"" or only for white victims? - and the failure to charge complicit bystanders who watched in silence. Most disturbingly, the ensuing ""right-wing embrace of bloodlust"" suggests we've become what Roxane Gay calls ""a people without empathy,"" a land of fear and paranoia where ""making people uncomfortable can now get you killed."" Along with our daily gun carnage, widespread 'other'-ing, police brutality and random acts of brutality - often linked to our festering failures to deal with poverty, homelessness, lack of physical or mental health care and other calamities born of egregious inequity - the ""list of things that can get you killed in public is expanding every single day. ""It only takes running into one scared man to have the worst and likely last day of your life,"" she writes. ""People who deem themselves judge, jury and executioner walk among us, and we have no real way of knowing when they will turn on us."" Today, residents and subway riders of a city with the nation's second biggest homeless population after LA have grown used to regular encounters with what health workers deem ""individuals in public spaces who are in evident psychiatric distress."" The numbers in New York dishearten: Estimates for those experiencing homelessness range from about 62,000 to nearly 103,000; most sleep in shelters, two-thirds have ""mental health needs” and perhaps 17% suffer from ""severe mental illness."" Meanwhile, mental health resources, especially inpatient, have shrunk over the last ten years - but yes, of course our defense spending, by far the world's highest, has stayed steady at or risen from almost $800 billion, why do you ask? - pushing public unease in response to fellow persons to an all-time high. We are Vigilantes 'R Us: From Bernie Goetz to Death Wish movies to George Zimmerman and Kyle Rittenhouse, the notion of vengeful patriots taking the law into their own hands has become ""part of the texture of American culture.” Given the systemic racism at that culture's core, says one legal expert, little wonder ""you're carrying around a whole bunch of messages (that) Black and Brown people are scarier than white ones,"" divergent reality notwithstanding. ""They have stereotyped our grandfathers, fathers, husbands, sons, and nephews as monsters,"" writes activist Renée Ater, ""subject to violence and death."" Jordan Neely had experienced mental health issues since he was 14, when his mother was murdered by an abusive boyfriend; her body was eventually discovered in a suitcase thrown into a river. Four years later, Neely testified at her killer's murder trial, telling the court he realized something was wrong when his mother didn't wake him as usual for school and her boyfriend blocked him from going into their bedroom. Neely had shared “an unbreakable bond” with his mother, said his father Andre Zachery: ""He loved her so much...After we buried her, he just wasn’t the same."" For years, he was known to many New Yorkers as a passionate moon-walking Michael Jackson who performed on the subway and street even as his mental health and housing struggles deepened. Larry Malcolm Smith got to know Neely a decade ago when they were both in foster care: While recent news accounts have focused on Neely's arrests for erratic or aggressive behavior, Smith recounts a kid who shared the money he made dancing with other hardscrabble kids: ""This was a good guy."" Neely reportedly kept trying to find housing; he'd been on a wait list for homeless people with acute needs, and outreach workers often spoke with him in shelters or at encampments. But Smith said the systems meant to protect him ultimately failed him: ""Jordan could have been housed, but nobody cares."" Predictably, that unkindness has persisted in the wake of his death, with harsh, he-was-no-angel media coverage and right-wing hate-mongering. News stories described an ""aggressive"" homeless man, an ""erratic"" subway passenger, a New York man ""threatening"" strangers, a ragged, malevolent street presence who ultimately, deservedly ""died"" - not ""was murdered"" - at the clean and noble hands of a ""Subway Samaritan.” That twisted, racist, popular Good Samaritan shtick swiftly stuck on Penny, and enraged many. At Neely's funeral Friday in Harlem, Rev. Al Sharpton decried how “people keep criminalizing people that need help” and noted, “A good Samaritan helps those in trouble - they don’t choke him out.” MSNBC's Mehdi Hassan chose to be baffled. ""I'm a Muslim, but I’ve read my Bible,"" he said. ""I’ve read the Gospel of Luke, the parable of the good Samaritan who helps the injured traveler after the priest and another man failed to do so. But I don’t remember the good Samaritan choking the traveler to death...John 13:35 says, 'By this all men will know you’re my disciples, by the love you show one another.'"" Others suggested MAGA-ites were confusing the Good Samaritan with the Marvel Comics' Punisher, a thug like those who take AR-15s to Starbucks and claim it's their God-given right to blow away anyone, especially if marginalized, who makes them feel ""uncomfortable."" Joining the preposterous Samaritan bandwagon was Ron 'Benito' DeSantis, who took time out from transforming his state into a fascist laboratory and trying to kill as many people as possible to urge fellow white supremacists to contribute to Penny's legal defense fund. “We must defeat the Soros-Funded DAs, stop the Left’s pro-criminal agenda, and take back the streets for law-abiding citizens,"" he intoned, ignoring the small detail that manslaughter is not ""law-abiding"" and being black, ill and unhoused is not (yet) a crime. ""We stand with Good Samaritans like Daniel Penny. Let’s show this Marine…America’s got his back."" And damn if it doesn't. The fund, set up on ""#1 Free Christian Fundraising Site” GiveSendGo - ""living out the heartbeat of God"" - has now raised almost $2.8 million from thousands of the devout also offering prayers and well wishes: ""Nobody else I'd rather be on the subway with,"" ""Thank you sir. May God be with you and your family during your time of need."" ""Mr. Penny is a hero,"" added Trump bestie Kid Rock to his $5,000. ""Alvin Bragg is a POS."" This, remember, from an allegedly law-and-order party now rallying behind vigilante violence deemed acceptable because it's upholding white supremacy, immunity and order while keeping Black people in their place. ""White people, and whiteness, are the law,"" writes Aaron Rupar. ""Black people are always on the wrong side of it."" In his first interview last weekend, with the right-wing New York Post , the ""soft-spoken and stoic"" Penny revealed he's a perfect exemplar of this perversely blind world-view. In a stunning mix of vapid, witless arrogance, he insisted he feels no shame about choking a sick, helpless black man to death 'cause a (white) guy's gotta do what he's gotta do. ""You know, I live an authentic and genuine life,"" he said. ""I mean, I always do what I think is right."" Still, ""It's tragic what happened to him"" - ""You. You happened to him"" - and ""the system has failed us."" US? His family is ""hanging in there. My mom is OK. My sisters understand. They all support me.” He relished being a Marine and the travel it afforded him: ""We went to Kuwait, Bahrain, Oman, Jordan...We stayed off the coast of Iran for a bit (during) that whole drone thing when they were shooting stuff down and stuff."" Travel ""really changed my perspective of the world...Just the friendliness and welcoming of everyone...You learn to have compassion and humility. I love helping people."" The story includes photos of him smiling with brown people who'd helped him on a road trip in Mexico as proof he's ""not a white supremacist."" ""I mean, it's a little bit comical. Everyone who's ever met me can tell you I love all people,"" he said. ""I was actually planning a road trip through Africa (a continent of 54 countries) before this (strangling a helpless black man) happened."" Somehow, Jordan Neely's grieving family remain unappeased. ""We never called him a white supremacist - we called him a killer,"" retorted their attorneys. They added, ""We don’t care how many vacations he’s been on. We want to know why he didn’t let go of that chokehold until Jordan was dead...Next time ask him why he didn’t let go when the passengers he was supposedly protecting were screaming, 'Let him go, you’re going to kill him.'"" Proclaiming ""Jordan Neely We Love You!"", his aunt Carolyn Neely set up a GoFundMe ""for love and justice"" that has raised just over $150,000, or far less than a 10th of what his killer has raised. Still, ""the incessant rat-a-tat-tat of bloody headlines"" - the unreasoning fear of a demonized 'other', the stochastic terrorism it often unleashes, and the inevitable, unconscionable valorization of the racist goons and bullies who commit it - goes on. In the New York Times, pundit David French summons - scary music here - Neely's ""deeply disturbing (and) menacing"" behavior to ask, ""What if Penny had done nothing? Would everyone, including Neely, have emerged from that subway car unscathed?"" Umm: Probably. Thus does he sanction the preemptive murder of an un-person in distress who committed no crime except existing because it might get violent. French: ""Jordan Neely should not have been in that subway car,"" (and he should have been where?) DA Alvin Bragg: ""Jordan Neely should still be alive today."" So should many others. Just before Neely's killing, a Walgreen guard in San Francisco shot and killed young, unhoused, black trans man Banko Brown for shoplifting...snacks. After outrage the guard wasn't charged and given the city's failures to provide housing and other services for Black trans youth, the DA is reconsidering the case. But despite Black Lives Matter et al, a Brown friend said, the hard reality endures: ""We don't all matter...It hurts me another trans person of color is gone without being seen. My people are not free."" Amidst our guns, rage, media-stoked paranoia that ""we are under constant assault from people known and unknown"" - gangs, migrants, deep state, woke teenagers - ""we see all around us the devaluing of human life,"" laments The Rude Pundit. ""If you see hurting people (and) you don't want to do anything to stop the hurting..if you think everyday things like a person ringing a doorbell are threats that need deadly force, then they aren't the ones who have lost their humanity. You are."" ""People have been living together with the potential for someone to commit a violent act since the beginning of time,"" notes Elizabeth Bruenig of a hostile, now-AR-15-infested world where ""there is no certainty,"" and never has been. Penny's murder of Neely is ""one means by which a healthy community becomes a violent society. It represents the loss of a peaceful commons, the absence of compassion, and the overwhelming fear we have come to accept in our culture of violence. This is the country we have become.""

1034,DeSantis,2023-05-24,"""Ron DeSantis had trouble announcing his presidential bid because Twitter's servers were 'kind of melting'""","Ron DeSantis was supposed to take to Twitter Spaces today to officially announce his bid for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. Unfortunately for the governor of Florida, it appears Twitter was not prepared for the influx of people who were waiting to listen to the announcement. Shortly after the Space went live, the broadcast dropped and DeSantis had to wait before he could say he was running to become the president of the United States of America. ""We've got so many people here that I think we are kind of melting the servers, which is a good sign,"" said Republican megadonor and Elon Musk confidant David Sacks said during a moment when the Space briefly returned before dropping again. The announcement eventually got underway after Twitter moved the Space to Sacks' account because Musk's ""account was breaking the system."" Sacks said the Space, with more than 500,000 people tuned in to listen at one point, was the largest group that had ""ever met online,"" a claim that was quickly ridiculed.      ""When Elon Musk stepped up to purchase Twitter he paid a lot of money for it. And I'm sure because he's a good businessman — Elon, I'm sure you'll end up making money off it — but bottom line is you had to put your money where your mouth is,"" DeSantis said of Musk's purchase of Twitter after the Space finally got underway. Musk’s decision to personally give DeSantis a platform should put to bed any questions about his politics. Since his takeover of the platform last October, the billionaire has repeatedly engaged with and enabled fringe far-right voices. At the start of December, Twitter reinstated the account of Andrew Anglin, the creator of the white supremacist website The Daily Stormer. Before that, Musk elevated conspiracy theories about the attack on Paul Pelosi. More recently, he has publicly attacked Anthony Fauci and George Soros. In helping DeSantis announce his presidential bid, Musk is aligning himself with a politician who has signed legislation that has restricted access to abortion and banned transition care for minors.Before today, Twitter, under its previous leadership, had never so directly engaged with a presidential candidate. At most, the platform's user-facing political outreach involved an election hub that pointed people to information on how to vote and livestreams devoted to debates between presidential candidates. Now the company plans to give former Fox News pundit Tucker Carlson a platform.During Donald Trump's years as president, the public got used to seeing a US leader use Twitter as a personal megaphone. The former president was banned from the website in 2021 in the aftermath of the January 6th US Capitol riot. Last November, Musk appeared to make the decision to reinstate Trump’s account on the results of a Twitter poll. The company reinstated Trump’s account on November 19th, 2022, but even with some attempted public coaxing from Musk, the former president has not tweeted since before his ban.The fact Twitter ran into technical difficulties should come as no surprise. Under Musk's leadership, the company has cut the majority of the workforce it had in place under former CEO Parag Agrawal, including much of the team responsible for its critical infrastructure.  This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/ron-desantis-cant-announce-hes-running-for-president-because-twitters-servers-are-kind-of-melting-222437047.html?src=rss",Engadget,Technology,No,20.560863689321767,99.61897060205584,99.99658902443475,30.493501739060704,59.39534562090104,58.77655145138085,ron desantis,{'bid': 'presidential'},"{'nomination': 'presidential', 'people': 'many', 'sign': 'good', 'megadonor': 'republican', 'group': 'largest', 'businessman': 'good', 'line': 'bottom', 'voices': 'right', 'theories': 'elevated', 'bid': 'presidential', 'care': 'banned', 'leadership': 'previous', 'candidate': 'presidential', 'outreach': 'political', 'candidates': 'presidential', 'pundit': 'former', 'megaphone': 'personal', 'president': 'former', 'difficulties': 'technical', 'team': 'responsible', 'infrastructure': 'critical'}",1,1

Friends of Ron DeSantis, a state PAC based in Florida that DeSantis established in 2018, and used to raise over $225 million through May 2023, has reportedly directed or transferred over $80 million to Never Back Down, a federal super PAC reportedly organized to serve as the primary spending vehicle in support of the Florida governor’s presidential campaign. Never Back Down has already spent over $944,000 to promote his presidential candidacy. The Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) has, for over 20 years, prohibited federal candidates like DeSantis from spending “soft money” in connection with a federal election because such funds are not subject to federal campaign finance laws that prevent corruption and require transparency in our elections. “Soft money undermines federal campaign finance laws because it is, by definition, money raised and spent outside the scope of those laws,” said Saurav Ghosh, director of federal campaign finance reform at Campaign Legal Center. “We’re talking about funds from billionaires and corporate special interests who could exert massive influence over the candidate they are financing. Laws banning these funds from being used to seek federal office are there for a reason – to prevent corruption, promote transparency, and ensure that wealthy special interests can’t rig the system even further in their favor.”As the complaint explains, DeSantis became a candidate well before his public announcement on May 24, 2023, and was therefore bound by the FECA provisions prohibiting candidates and the entities they establish, finance, maintain, or control from spending soft money in connection with federal elections. As a result, Friends of Ron DeSantis — recently renamed “Empower Parents PAC” as part of a clear effort to distance the group from DeSantis — brazenly violated the law when it transferred this colossal sum to a federal super PAC.The FEC is responsible for enforcing federal campaign finance laws and should investigate whether Governor DeSantis and the Friends of Ron DeSantis state PAC violated the law by making this transfer.",Common Dreams,Top,Yes,22.279578853141498,98.58490830778544,99.95628942151524,38.205842522617786,61.040382575877985,48.89120887359998,campaign legal,{},"{'money': 'soft', 'limits': 'federal', 'elections': 'federal', 'vehicle': 'primary', 'campaign': 'federal', 'candidacy': 'presidential', 'candidates': 'federal', 'election': 'federal', 'funds': 'such', 'laws': 'federal', 'reform': 'federal', 'interests': 'special', 'influence': 'massive', 'office': 'federal', 'announcement': 'public', 'effort': 'clear', 'sum': 'colossal', 'super': 'federal'}",1,0

The MVP is a proposed 303-mile fracked-gas pipeline that would run through West Virginia and southwest Virginia and result in as much carbon pollution annually as 26 coal-fired power plants. Its approval was inserted into the agreement as a political favor from President Joe Biden to Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV) in return for his vote for the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. An amendment to remove the MVP provisions was introduced by Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA) in the Senate and Congresswoman Jennifer McClellan (D-VA) in the House of Representatives, and supported by the entire Virginia Democratic delegation, but neither effort was successful. The Fiscal Responsibility Act, which now awaits the President’s signature, declares that completion of the MVP “is required in the national interest.” It requires the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to issue all permits within 21 days of the law’s enactment and hamstrings other government agencies, bypassing their long-established environmental review processes. Finally, it prohibits courts from reviewing all pending and future permits for MVP. The bill also undercuts the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), undermining decades of environmental protections, and requires the President to approve a laundry list of fossil fuel projects every year through 2030. Victoria Higgins, Virginia Director for the Chesapeake Climate Action Network, stated: “First, I want to express our heartfelt gratitude to Senator Kaine and Congresswoman McClellan for championing the effort to remove MVP from this bill. Today, we are grieving for the families in southwest Virginia who have fought this pipeline tooth and nail for eight years. Their home should not be sacrificed as a political favor. We are grieving for ourselves, and especially our young people, for whom this represents a huge step backwards in our urgent fight against climate change. Their future should not be a bargaining chip. And we are grieving for our lands and waters, cherished places which will now be less protected.""But let us be clear: more than anything, we are furious. We feel betrayed by the Biden administration, who transparently traded the people and land of Southwest Virginia for a vote. The President’s commitment to climate and environmental justice is merely rhetoric if he continues to approve massive new fossil fuel infrastructure and reduce and sidestep community and judicial review. We’re equally furious at the Republicans who threatened to drive our economy off the cliff to pursue their political ends. We will not take this lying down. Our fight against the Mountain Valley Pipeline is not over.”Chesapeake Climate Action Network has been involved in the fight to stop the Mountain Valley Pipeline since 2015 through organizing and legal action.

Extremist lawmakers extracted harmful concessions in exchange for the votes necessary to pass the bill.Below is a statement by David Watkins, director of government affairs for the Climate and Energy Program at the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS). “Defaulting on our national debt would have been catastrophic for the United States and had substantial ripple effects across the entire world. While we can be grateful that we avoided economic catastrophe, there are people who will be hurting as a result of the provisions in this deal, including impoverished older people and environmental justice communities.“The expanded work requirements added to the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, mean older people who have had trouble finding work could lose access to essential food assistance, even as data show that work requirements don’t alleviate poverty or improve employment outcomes.“Rubber stamping approval for the Mountain Valley Pipeline is a slap in the face to local communities whose health and environment will be harmed by this project. It’s also an egregious giveaway to fossil fuel interests at time when we face an urgent climate crisis.“The National Environmental Policy Act—the crown jewel in the laws that can protect environmental justice communities from harmful projects—wasn’t broken and didn’t need to be fixed. The damaging provisions in the bill that undercut NEPA will have profoundly negative consequences. Some of the changes, such as putting a page limit on environmental impact statements, are just juvenile.“Meanwhile, the transmission study mandated by this bill will, at best, do no harm and at worst could delay decisions another two years while a study is being conducted that will tell us things that we already know.“Thankfully, some of the extreme provisions House Republican were demanding, such as rescinding investments in clean energy that are part of the Inflation Reduction Act, did not come to pass.“But let’s be clear. Extremist lawmakers were willing to hold the nation’s credit hostage to their narrow partisan interests and created an entirely manufactured crisis that stood to harm working people the most. Playing chicken is no way to run a country or show leadership.”In addition to Watkins, the following UCS experts are available for interviews: Food and Environment Deputy Director Karen Perry Stillerman can speak about the changes in the SNAP program. UCS Transmission Policy Manager Sam Gomberg can discuss how the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) already has substantial authority to drive investments in the transmission system.

At the next negotiations, the United States should take direct aim at the pervasive plastic that’s infiltrating every corner of our planet by hitting hard on production.”Many country delegates and groups in attendance as observers, including the Center, expressed support for including mandatory measures in the treaty to reduce plastic production. Participants also called for prohibiting false solutions often suggested by industry representatives, such as “chemical” or “advanced” recycling that they misleadingly label “circular.”The U.S. delegation in Paris was instrumental in resolving initial procedural debates, which focused on whether to adopt a consensus or a majority voting process throughout the negotiations. Its diplomacy helped move the negotiations into core discussions on the treaty’s potential contents. In the latter part of the week, delegates split into two groups to begin working out the treaty’s core elements, including obligations, financial mechanisms and other implementation measures.But the United States stopped short of supporting any mandatory measures that will directly reduce plastic production and consumption and focused almost exclusively on voluntary measures and measures left to national definition.Negotiations were marred by complaints from stakeholder groups about limited access to sessions and calls to give Indigenous Peoples and frontline and fenceline communities a bigger and more meaningful platform.The next negotiating session, INC-3, will take place in Nairobi, Kenya, in November 2023.",Common Dreams,Business,No,23.31094770319413,24.315187785469025,47.23733639541937,42.83387409678127,61.80540970031266,36.72334072460065,global plastics,{},"{'session': 'next', 'commitments': 'firm', 'negotiations': 'next', 'options': 'identified', 'document': 'preliminary', 'talks': 'substantive', 'commitment': 'bold', 'attorney': 'senior', 'front': 'plastic', 'aim': 'direct', 'plastic': 'pervasive', 'measures': 'voluntary', 'production': 'plastic', 'solutions': 'false', 'recycling': 'advanced', 'debates': 'procedural', 'contents': 'potential', 'part': 'latter', 'mechanisms': 'financial', 'definition': 'national', 'access': 'limited', 'platform': 'bigger'}",0,1

1425,DeSantis,2023-06-06,"""Pay-To-Play Laws May Complicate Governor DeSantis’ Presidential Fundraising""","Political Law AlertAfter recently signing legislation allowing state officeholders to run for president without resigning from office, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis has officially entered the 2024 presidential race. As a sitting governor, DeSantis’ candidacy may implicate federal and state pay-to-play laws, including Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) Rule 206(4)-5, Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board (“MSRB”) Rule G-37, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission (“CFTC”) Rule 23.451. Although Governor DeSantis is seeking federal office, his status as a state officeholder means that individuals and entities who engage in business activities covered by these rules may be subject to contribution limits significantly lower than the $3,300 per election limit that individuals may contribute to federal candidates under federal election laws.  Consequently, federal pay-to-play rules will likely present a fundraising challenge for Governor DeSantis’ presidential campaign, and necessitate compliance measures for the donors covered under these rules.  A single excessive contribution to DeSantis’ campaign by a covered employee could jeopardize a company’s ability to transact certain business with the state of Florida. For example, SEC Rule 206(4)-5 prohibits investment advisers from providing investment advisory services for compensation to a state or local government entity if the adviser, or a covered associate of the adviser, has made a political contribution to certain state or local government officials during the prior two years. Covered associates include general partners, managing members, executive officers of an investment adviser, employees who solicit a government entity for the investment adviser, and any persons who supervise such employees. The rule prohibits contributions to candidates for, and incumbents holding, any elective office which has the authority to directly or indirectly influence the hiring of an investment adviser or to appoint a person with such authority. Similarly, MSRB Rule G-37 prohibits brokers and dealers from engaging in municipal securities business with a municipal entity for compensation if the broker, dealer, or a covered associate has made a political contribution to an official with authority over dealer selection. Covered associates include municipal finance representatives, municipal solicitors, municipal finance principals, supervisors of any municipal finance principal, and members of a dealer’s executive or management committee. Also, CFTC Rule 23.451 restricts political contributions from swap dealers or their covered associates to officials responsible for hiring swap dealers to service state or local government clients for compensation. The same categories of associates covered under SEC Rule 206(4)-5 are covered for purposes of the CFTC rule.  Take note that PACs controlled by persons or entities covered under any of these pay-to-play rules are also covered.  The SEC and CFTC rules permit a de minimis contribution of up to $350 per election to covered officials for whom the contributor is entitled to. The MSRB rule allows for a de minimis contribution of up to $250 per election for covered individuals who are entitled to vote for the candidate.  The federal pay-to-play rules permit any covered individual in the country to contribute up to the applicable de minimis amount to presidential candidates.   Violations of applicable pay-to-play rules result in a two-year ban on providing advisory services for compensation to a government client.  Obtaining a refund of an excessive contribution does not absolve a violation, though federal regulators have the discretion to issue a waiver in the event of an excessive contribution.  The waiver process can be long, however, and there is no guarantee a waiver will ultimately be granted.  While limiting contributions to a presidential candidate may seem unusual, these issues frequently arise when state or local officeholders seek federal office. In 2016, covered associates were confronted with the same challenges regarding contributions to the Trump-Pence ticket before Mike Pence resigned as governor of Indiana. Former Governor Chris Christie’s 2016 presidential campaign faced the similar fundraising obstacles. Please note that federal pay-to-play rules also restrict contributions to certain state or local officeholders running for U.S. House or Senate. Additionally, state and local pay-to-play rules may also restrict political contributions from entities conducting business with specific state and local agencies, as well as those entities’ employees. With respect to Governor DeSantis, Florida’s pay-to-play laws regulating persons who conduct business with the Florida Housing Finance Corporation (FHFC) and Division of Bond Finance appear to only limit contributions to candidates for governor.  However, we have been informally advised that the FHFC is currently reviewing the issue. Investment advisers and others contracting for government services should review political contributions compliance procedures to mitigate the risk of violations of SEC Rule 206(4)-5, MSRB Rule G-37, or any of the numerous state and local pay-to-play laws.  The Akin Political Law team will continue to monitor developments to keep clients informed on this and other key issues.  We are available to develop and implement compliance programs, conduct due diligence and pre-clear contributions for businesses covered by federal, state and local pay-to-play rules.",Akin,Top,No,23.86500526946279,99.6343393131989,98.90906029054356,45.32008056933925,60.435317836796024,47.65211954471209,pay laws,{},"{'race': 'presidential', 'governor': 'sitting', 'laws': 'numerous', 'office': 'federal', 'limits': 'lower', 'candidates': 'presidential', 'rules': 'federal', 'campaign': 'presidential', 'measures': 'necessitate', 'contribution': 'excessive', 'employee': 'covered', 'business': 'certain', 'services': 'advisory', 'associate': 'covered', 'officials': 'covered', 'years': 'prior', 'associates': 'covered', 'partners': 'general', 'members': 'managing', 'officers': 'executive', 'employees': 'such', 'authority': 'such', 'securities': 'municipal', 'entity': 'municipal', 'representatives': 'municipal', 'solicitors': 'municipal', 'principals': 'municipal', 'principal': 'municipal', 'contributions': 'clear', 'categories': 'same', 'individuals': 'covered', 'individual': 'covered', 'amount': 'applicable', 'regulators': 'federal', 'candidate': 'presidential', 'challenges': 'same', 'obstacles': 'similar', 'state': 'certain', 'agencies': 'specific', 'issues': 'key', 'diligence': 'due'}",1,0

Contributing to any political campaign (including a presidential primary campaign) implicates various federal pay-to-play rules, including: Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 206(4)-5 (the “SEC Pay-to-Play Rule”), Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rule G-37, and Commodity Futures Trading Commission Rule 23.451. State-level pay-to-play laws may also apply to campaigns of any state officials.  Unlike many other states, North Dakota does not have its own state-level pay-to-play rules; however, federal rules may impose lower contribution limits on contributors to Burgum’s campaign, thus presenting fundraising obstacles similar to those facing Florida Governor Ron  DeSantis.  The SEC Pay-to-Play Rule prohibits an investment adviser from receiving compensation for investment advisory services provided to a government entity within the two years following a contribution to an associated “official.” An “official” is a holder of, or a candidate for, an elective office that has the requisite amount of control or influence over the hiring of an investment adviser by a government entity.  The CFTC and MSRB rules contain similar prohibitions.  In assessing requests to make campaign contributions, advisers and other covered financial industry participants should consider the extent to which Governor Burgum is an “official” of a covered governmental entity under the Pay-to-Play Rule (or holds equivalent status under the MSRB and CFTC rules).  As with all pay-to-play assessments, a careful review of each governmental entity’s charter, powers, and operations should be considered. All three federal pay-to-play regimes permit any covered individual in the country to contribute up to the applicable de minimis amount ($350 per election for the SEC and CFTC; $250 under the MSRB rule) to presidential candidates.  For non-presidential campaigns, the applicable de minimis limits vary depending whether the contributor is entitled to vote for the candidate.  For more information on federal pay-to-play rules, please refer to Akin’s June 6, 2023 alert regarding contributions to Governor DeSantis’ campaign.  The Akin Political Law team will continue to monitor developments to keep clients informed on this and other key issues.  We are available to develop and implement compliance programs, conduct due diligence and pre-clear contributions for businesses covered by federal, state, and local pay-to-play rules.",Akin,Top,No,23.956464471717187,93.20367411310777,96.99852039989996,45.73048279911335,44.42814172351598,27.319307669377995,north dakota,{},"{'nomination': 'presidential', 'need': 'urgent', 'participants': 'covered', 'industry': 'financial', 'contribution': 'political', 'education': 'internal', 'campaign': 'primary', 'rules': 'local', 'states': 'other', 'limits': 'applicable', 'obstacles': 'similar', 'services': 'advisory', 'official': 'associated', 'office': 'elective', 'amount': 'applicable', 'prohibitions': 'similar', 'entity': 'governmental', 'status': 'equivalent', 'review': 'careful', 'regimes': 'federal', 'individual': 'covered', 'candidates': 'presidential', 'campaigns': 'presidential', 'information': 'more', 'issues': 'key', 'diligence': 'due', 'contributions': 'clear'}",1,0

And the sad fact is that his party doesn’t seem to careDonald Trump announced his latest indictment last night in front of a painting of a guy literally twirling his moustache. “I am an innocent man,” the former president insisted, next to this cartoon shorthand for villainy. The oil painting in question is not so much an artwork as a lift-music version of an artwork, and seems to hang at Trump’s Bedminster golf club in New Jersey – which is the same place he buried his former wife Ivana, as all admirers of both exquisite taste and private-cemetery tax breaks may already know. Either way, Ivana’s there, right near the first tee. It’s what she would have wanted.As for her surviving ex-husband, it’s fashionable to say that anything that would represent a catastrophic setback for any other human being is exactly what Trump would have wanted. By this metric, his indictment on federal charges for the first time, including under the Espionage Act, is an absolute gift and a triumph. He’ll use it to pull in fundraising, it’ll rally his base, it’ll make every Republican beta – which is to say, every Republican – feel they have to swear loyalty to him. Furthermore, it’s already got him right where he most loves to be: with everyone talking about him. And these are all reasonable points – or at least reasonable in a through-the-looking-glass way, given that to many outside observers the United States passed reason two or three election cycles ago.

Milligan, which concerns Alabama’s 2022 congressional map, appeared to be potential vehicles for the court to recast the law in a sharply conservative direction. But last week, a closely divided court tempered such hopes, as Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. and Justice Brett M.

Thompson ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. Election maps across the Deep South are likely to be redrawn because of a surprise Supreme Court ruling that upheld a key provision of the Voting Rights Act, changes that could alter the balance of power that has given Republicans a razor-thin majority in Congress. The court’s 5-4 decision in Allen v. Milligan, written for the majority by Chief Justice John Roberts, affirmed the section of the act that prohibits maps drawn to dilute minority voting strength. It was an unexpected victory for a law passed in 1965, which has been gradually dismantled under the Roberts court. The Supreme Court is now expected to rule quickly on a similar challenge to election maps pending in Louisiana, which could create another congressional district favorable to Democrats in addition to the one in Alabama. And a racial gerrymandering case from South Carolina is moving toward oral arguments in October. Republican state leaders appealed a decision from a three-judge federal panel that found illegal targeting of Black voters in a map that gave the GOP control of the state’s last remaining swing district. If the panel’s decision is upheld, the Republican-led legislature will have to redraw the lines for the 1st Congressional District. Republicans won a slim majority in the House in 2022 as legal challenges over redistricting simmered, including the one in Alabama, which the court stayed until after the election. If all of the redistricting challenges were resolved in favor of minority plaintiffs, that could dramatically impact the composition of Congress in 2024. David Wasserman, a senior editor at Cook Political Report, said states creating new majority-minority districts may also need to reconfigure numerous surrounding districts, further altering election maps. The ruling did not expand the Voting Rights Act but merely maintained the status quo. Nevertheless, it was an unexpected setback to the Republican Party’s redistricting operation. Alabama’s Republican-led Legislature drew only one seat offering an opportunity for Black candidates to win. Black Alabama voters had hoped to create a second congressional district that would offer an opportunity for an additional seat for a minority candidate. Today, 2 in 7 Alabama voters are Black but 6 of 7 congressional seats are held by white politicians. Republicans argued in a court brief that Democrats were “exploiting” the opening created by the Alabama case to make a power grab. Roberts’ opinion brought a strongly worded dissent from conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who accused the majority — including his colleague Brett M. Kavanaugh — of creating a “consciously segregated districting system” in the name of the Voting Rights Act. But the South Carolina case offers a case study in how nuanced redistricting cases can be. A ProPublica story in May showed that one of the state’s most powerful Democrats, Rep. Jim Clyburn, made recommendations behind the scenes to protect his seat. That ultimately also helped the GOP. Lawyers for South Carolina Republican leaders argued that they did not intentionally target Black voters and followed Clyburn’s wishes. Any state with a long history of “extremely polarized” voting is likely to feel the impact of the Alabama decision, which relied heavily on expert analysis of “airtight data” of racial voting patterns, said Christian R. Grose, a University of Southern California political science professor. A pending federal case in El Paso, Texas, brought by MALDEF, a Latino civil rights organization, challenges maps drawn in 2021 by the Texas Legislature that limited the number of districts in which Black and Latino people make up the majority of eligible voters. Nina Perales, MALDEF’s vice president for litigation, said she’s encouraged by the Alabama decision, which “affirmed the traditional test” for fair maps and “closed the door on fringe theories that undermine voting rights.” The Louisiana case was put on hold while the court considered Alabama, and minority groups believe a favorable decision could unlock a second majority Black district in the state. Louisiana’s Republican attorney general, Jeff Landry, asked the court in a letter to schedule oral arguments in the dispute. In Florida, a map drawn by Gov. Ron DeSantis and approved by the Legislature may have violated the state constitution in eliminating a congressional district held by a Black Democrat. Voting rights groups have challenged the map, and a Democratic consultant told the Tampa Bay Times that the Alabama decision could signal to the courts that race is a legitimate factor to consider in redistricting. Richard Pildes, a constitutional law professor at New York University, said the Alabama case shows that states now have new technologies that “allow plaintiffs to search out potential VRA districts in ways not possible in prior decades.” This makes it harder for states to make excuses that they could not draw maps offering opportunities for minority voters. Marina Jenkins, executive director of the National Democratic Foundation, which provided legal support for the Alabama plaintiffs, said she expects the court to move quickly to send some of the disputed maps back to state legislatures for redrawing. The process will not always be smooth, she said, since some of the lawmakers have resisted efforts to broaden minority representation. If legislatures do not act, the courts could step in to remedy the mapping errors. Democrats in Alabama believed the Supreme Court thwarted minorities in 2022 by delaying its consideration of the case until after the election. “We’re obviously very happy to see success in the case and excited that voters will be able to have more fair representation,” Jenkins said. “But it is obviously disappointing that this could have been representation that those voters already had.”",Propublica,Top,No,22.27863055521729,87.72560629087793,58.67004393002586,38.20158725280357,71.99321468878368,52.276296748373376,voting maps,{},"{'newsroom': 'nonprofit', 'stories': 'biggest', 'ruling': 'surprise', 'provision': 'key', 'majority': 'second', 'victory': 'unexpected', 'challenge': 'similar', 'district': 'congressional', 'case': 'federal', 'arguments': 'oral', 'leaders': 'republican', 'panel': 'federal', 'targeting': 'illegal', 'voters': 'eligible', 'legislature': 'led', 'challenges': 'legal', 'editor': 'senior', 'districts': 'potential', 'setback': 'unexpected', 'candidates': 'black', 'seat': 'additional', 'seats': 'congressional', 'politicians': 'white', 'dissent': 'worded', 'system': 'segregated', 'cases': 'nuanced', 'history': 'long', 'voting': 'polarized', 'analysis': 'expert', 'patterns': 'racial', 'science': 'political', 'organization': 'latino', 'rights': 'civil', 'people': 'black', 'test': 'traditional', 'maps': 'disputed', 'decision': 'favorable', 'general': 'republican', 'consultant': 'democratic', 'factor': 'legitimate', 'law': 'constitutional', 'technologies': 'new', 'ways': 'possible', 'decades': 'prior', 'director': 'executive', 'support': 'legal', 'minorities': 'thwarted', 'representation': 'fair'}",0,1

1758,DeSantis,2023-06-15,"""Audio of Ron DeSantis saying ‘p*ssy’ is as unpleasant as you’d image""","Analysis The campaign trail is a candidate's chance to define or redefine their public image. Does the electorate think you're a prematurely elderly, out-of-touch religious zealot? Well, slip into some leather and hop on a motorcycle like former Vice President Mike Pence. Are you an unknown tech bro with presidential ambitions? Show up to a former president's arraignment and make a ham-handed attempt to grab headlines by demanding your rivals sign a pledge to pardon him. But what if you're Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R)? Thanks to Fox News and DeSantis' former status as the chief presidential suck-up, he's a known quantity. As with any candidate, this is both a positive and a negative. It certainly doesn't help matters that DeSantis is campaigning for the presidency with all the grace of a rabid porcupine. Not even the simple act of greeting a baby can make him come across as anything but ChatGPT pretending to converse with the hoi polloi. Assuming he's is not going to win many points on the likeability scale by eating pudding with his fingers (allegedly), inspiring ""pure hatred"" in his staff, and treating members of his own party (including donors) with the warmth of a White Walker, the best play is for DeSantis to do what comes naturally: attack, attack, attack. DeSantis relishes attacking his enemies, both real and imagined. Some might even say it's his kink. Just ask undocumented immigrants, transgender people, pregnant people, Disney, teachers, drag queens, and books. Today, Florida's governor set his sights on California Governor Gavin Newsom (D). DeSantis enjoys going after Newsom and California almost as much as he enjoys firing people. In his speech, DeSantis challenged Newsom to seek the Democratic presidential nomination and accused him of having a ""bizarre"" and ""serious fixation"" on Florida. ""What I would tell him is stop pussyfooting around,"" DeSantis said. ""Are you gonna throw your hat in the ring and challenge [President Joe Biden] ... or are you just gonna sit on the sidelines and chirp?"" https://www.twitter.com/therecount/status/1669382261400035328 (DeSantis was probably mad that Newsom called him a ""small, pathetic man"" for flying migrants to California on Floridian taxpayers' dimes.) Mature observers made points about the unlikelihood of Newsom running against Biden, DeSantis' own yearlong shadow campaign before his official announcement, and the fact that DeSantis' state might be big, but Newsom's is bigger. Less mature observers zeroed in on DeSantis saying the word ""pussy."" No, he was not talking about genitalia. No, he wasn't bragging about grabbing one. And, yes, he properly used the term ""pussyfooting."" There's just something deeply uncomfortable about hearing Governor Pudding Fingers say ""pussy."" https://twitter.com/XLAnimosity/status/1669417127944568851 Maybe it's his track record of policing vaginas. Maybe it's that absence of charm. Either way, DeSantis could do us all a favor and omit ""pussy"" from his stump speeches. For the children.

1840,DeSantis,2023-06-19,"""‘I just can’t do that’: DeSantis refused to serve Bud Light while playing bartender for veterans""","If Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis is your bartender, don’t try to order a Bud Light.  The 2024 presidential candidate jumped behind the bar for patrons at The Bunker at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post in Sparks, Nevada during a campaign stop on Friday but refused to serve one particular drink: Bud Light. The beer brand faced backlash and a conservative boycott after its partnership with Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender activist. It’s since become a flashpoint in the right-wing’s ever-growing anti-LGBTQ movement. “Just so you know, I'll serve you anything except Bud Light. I just can't do that,” DeSantis said.  A spokesperson for DeSantis posted a clip of the interaction on Saturday. https://twitter.com/lindseycurnutte/status/1670083879607373825/ In an April interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson, DeSantis said he would no longer drink Bud Light anymore because he didn’t want to support “woke companies” and their goals of ""trying to change our country, trying to change policy, [and] trying to change [the] culture."" ""Why would you want to drink Bud Light? I mean like honestly, that’s like them rubbing our faces in it, and it’s like these companies that do this, if they never have any response, they are just gonna keep doing it,"" DeSantis said. But while DeSantis might not be kicking back with a bottle of Bud Light any time soon, he hasn’t moved to penalize Anheuser-Busch—which employs about 800 in the state—in any notable way, according to a report by HuffPost. Anheuser-Busch operates both a brewery and a can factory in Jacksonville, and in 2015—pre-DeSantis’ governorship—Anheuser-Busch chose its Jacksonville can factory over two competing cities to increase its production of aluminum bottles. Over a two-year period, the company invested $170 million and created 75 new jobs to expand its factory to produce aluminum bottles. In doing so, it received $3 million in grants from Florida on top of $12 million in grants and other incentives from Jacksonville, according to HuffPost. And while DeSantis and others may say the beer maker has gone “woke”—the money paints a different picture.  Last election cycle, nearly $400,000 (or 62%) of Anheuser-Busch’s contributions at a federal level went to Republicans, according to the nonpartisan watchdog site OpenSecrets. That figure doesn’t include state-level giving, such as the $47,080 the company has given the Republican Party of Florida since the beginning of this year. Anheuser-Busch also gave the state party about $80,000 during the 2022 cycle, $50,000 of which came in August amid DeSantis’ reelection bid. The company also dropped a $50,000 contribution to DeSantis’ committee in February 2021, according to state campaign finance records. Some prominent conservatives, including Donald Trump Jr., opposed the boycott because of the company’s long history of contributing to Republican causes. But many DeSantis supporters have pointed to the Floridian’s pro-boycott stance as evidence that he’d make a better president than Donald Trump (the former president himself largely remained silent on the issue, before eventually remarking in May that the boycott is proof ""money does talk”). “Ron DeSantis will talk s*** about Bud Light for what they've done and Disney because he don't care about the donations and the money,” one user tweeted. “But Donald Trump will coward down to these companies because of the money.” https://twitter.com/AntStith/status/1670772986058514438 “What's impressive about DeSantis is he will not let donor demands sway him,” wrote another user on Sunday. https://twitter.com/patmcguinness/status/1670639728230580224 DeSantis’ press secretary linked to an article about Trump Jr.'s opposition to the boycott with a simple clown emoji response on Saturday, as the video of DeSantis gained traction. https://twitter.com/JeremyRedfernFL/status/1670086043578630144 The Daily Dot has reached out to DeSantis’ campaign for comment.

Suarez is the latest candidate to enter the growing field for the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. With Suarez’s June 15 announcement, he became the third state or local officeholder to enter the GOP race—joining Florida Governor Ron DeSantis and North Dakota Governor Doug Burgum. Mayor Suarez’s candidacy, as a current local official, highlights the critical need for investment advisers, broker-dealers and other financial industry participants to update their political contribution approval procedures and internal education efforts. Contributing to any political campaign (including for a presidential primary) potentially implicates various federal pay-to-play rules, including: Securities and Exchange Commission Rule 206(4)-5 (the “SEC Rule”). Municipal Securities Rulemaking Board Rule G-37 (the “MSRB Rule”). Commodity Futures Trading Commission Rule 23.451 (the “CFTC Rule”). Prospective contributors to Mayor Suarez’s presidential campaign who are covered by these rules should therefore determine whether the mayor has the authority to influence the selection of advisers to Miami municipal retirement plans (under the SEC Rule) or issuers of municipal bonds (under the MSRB Rule). It is not uncommon for mayors to possess such authority. As with all pay-to-play assessments, a careful review of each governmental entity’s charter, powers and operations should be considered. State and local pay-to-play laws may also apply to candidates for president who are state or local officeholders. Although Florida has state-level pay-to-play rules (which should not apply to municipal candidates or officeholders), the city of Miami does not.

Ron DeSantis (R) made a stop in “the once great city” of San Francisco, a visit that he claimed was filled with drugs and “riff raff.” While that might sound like a fun time to some, it wasn’t up the Floridian’s alley. “We came in here and we saw people defecating on the street, we saw people using heroin, we saw people smoking crack cocaine,” DeSantis said in a video posted Tuesday. “And you look around, the city is not vibrant anymore.” https://twitter.com/RonDeSantis/status/1671300453521408001 The visit followed a campaign stop by the 2024 presidential hopeful in Sacramento, where he spoke at a “roundtable breakfast” at Del Paso Country Club on Monday.  The stop comes just a few weeks after DeSantis’ administration flew 36 migrants to the California capital, an act that California Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) said may amount to “kidnapping.” https://twitter.com/GavinNewsom/status/1665769565261840387 The DeSantis campaign has sought to contrast DeSantis to Newsom, amid continued murmurs that the California governor is considering launching a 2024 bid—though he has repeatedly sworn off the idea of primarying President Joe Biden. Last week, DeSantis challenged Newsom to “stop pussyfooting around” about 2024. “Are you gonna throw your hat in the ring and challenge [Biden] … or are you just gonna sit on the sidelines and chirp?” In a separate ad shared to social media on Monday, the DeSantis campaign wrote that “California’s liberal governance is a disaster,” and that DeSantis’ “conservative policies have Florida thriving, and would do so for the nation.” DeSantis continued to criticize California’s “leftist policies” during Tuesday’s San Francisco video, saying “these policies have caused people to flee this area.” “They don’t prosecute criminals like they do in most parts of the country, and the wreckage has really, really been sad to see,” he continued. “And so I’ve seen so many businesses boarded up, I’ve seen so much riff raff just running around and it just shows you these policies matter, leadership matters.” DeSantis later jabbed: “No wonder why we’ve had so many people move from San Francisco to Florida over the last few years.” While the tweet largely garnered praise from DeSantis supporters in the replies, some people argued the Florida governor has other things to worry about in his state first. “The hilarious part about this video is everything he is complaining about here is also taking place within about a two mile radius of Florida's Governor's Mansion,” tweeted one user. https://twitter.com/RealJacobPerry/status/1671507792920756225 “Go deal with Florida,” wrote another. https://twitter.com/todayinoakland/status/1671347216940957699 A third user tweeted that DeSantis had “incredible chutzpah to assert that extreme poverty” is caused by leftist policies. “He’s literally in the mecca of tech capitalism.” Sign up to receive the Daily Dot’s Internet Insider newsletter for urgent news from the frontline of online.

Ron DeSantis’ (R) 2024 presidential bid. ""Warning: The contents of this mailer include sexually graphic materials that Ron DeSantis removed from schools,” the mailer says. According to a Fox News report, the mailer aims to counter criticism of DeSantis’ support last year for HB 1467, a law that established strict review requirements for school books. ""Only DeSantis is battling and winning against woke corporations, trying to brainwash our kids—even the most powerful ones in his own backyard,"" the mailer reads. ""Ron DeSantis is the only leader standing up to the Woke elites for parents and kids."" Never Back Down’s mailers also reference DeSantis’ ongoing feud with Disney, arguing he is the only candidate “battling and WINNING against woke corporations trying to brainwash our kids—even the most powerful ones in his own backyard.” According to data from the Federal Election Committee, the PAC has spent more than $6 million in independent expenditures since April, the vast majority of which ($4.3 million) has gone into Iowa, the state hosting the first-in-the-nation Republican primary caucus. Its second biggest target has been South Carolina, another traditionally early caucus state, which has seen $1.9 million in spending. Never Back Down’s newest mailers featured excerpts from Maia Kobabe’s Gender Queer: A Memoir that talked about sock stuffing and masturbation, according to Fox News.  Kobabe’s book is reportedly America’s most banned book, having been pulled from the shelves of at least 49 school districts in Florida, Texas, Michigan, Utah, and other states. “I feel a responsibility not to be quiet about censorship,” Kobabe told the Los Angeles Times. “We’re at this moment where I think there are more than ever trans and nonbinary actors, authors, artists, politicians, but there’s also more than ever legislation trying to limit the access to healthcare for trans students, access to sports teams or school clubs. Access to books.” Opponents have painted DeSantis’ actions as a book ban, but the Florida governor argues that not “a single book"" has been banned in Florida. While the ban doesn’t affect bookstores and non-educational settings, the law has reduced students’ access to certain books. Since it took effect, at least 23 school districts have removed books from their schools’ shelves, according to a press release from DeSantis’ office. “Of the 175 books removed across the state, 164 (94%) were removed from media centers, and 153 (87%) were identified as pornographic, violent, or inappropriate for their grade level,” the release said. It added examples saying parents found—and districts then banned—such as: Gender Queer: A Memoir, an “explicit, pornographic book showing sex acts;” Flamer, a “graphic book about young boys performing sexual acts at a summer camp;” This Book Is Gay, “a book containing instructions on ‘the ins and outs of gay sex;’” and Let’s Talk About It, a book “that contains graphic depictions about how to masturbate.” A survey by PEN America found that “overwhelmingly, book banners continue to target stories by and about people of color and LGBTQ+ individuals,” with 26% of titles banned during the first half of the 2022-2023 school year featuring LGBTQ+ themes or characters. But some non-sexually explicit books have been pulled from school shelves under the sweeping law, which allows parents to review a school district’s instructional material and empowers them to lodge complaints about any book or subject matter they believe is inappropriate for students. The law has resulted in teachers and educators ""walking on eggshells,"" and erring on the side of caution amid concerns that inadvertently violating the law could result in a third-degree felony. According to the Tampa Bay Times, other instances of books being pulled from shelves in some schools include And Tango Makes Three, a children’s book about a baby penguin raised by two males; It’s Okay to Be Different, which includes the lines “It’s okay to have different moms” and “It’s okay to have different dads;” and The Hate U Give, which contains some sexual content but mainly focuses on racism and police brutality. DeSantis has consistently trailed former President Donald Trump in Republican primary polls, however, an Emerson College national poll released Thursday found that the Floridian made a 5-point gain since April. The latest poll shows Trump with 59% of support among Republican primary voters, while DeSantis came in second with 21%.

It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them,"" Obi-Wan DeSantis says, implying that Trump had lost his way as an America first hardline Republican. In recent months, as his presidential campaign ramped up, DeSantis has attacked Trump from the right, criticizing him on everything from immigration to his COVID-19 policies. It concludes with Trump screaming ""I hate you."" That's all well and good in the vacuum of the 22-second video, but nothing online lives without context (and obsessive fandoms), which meant people were swift to note what would happen if you extrapolated further. After leaving Trump for dead (defeating him in a CPAC straw poll or something), instead of ascending to power (the presidency), DeSantis would actually flee to the galaxy's largest cesspool of scum and villainy, home to its worst bars (gonna assume Panama City) and hide as a wrecked shell of his former while Trump ascended to absolute power and murdered him (defeated him in the 2024 primary). To go even further (why not?), right before dying, DeSantis would dedicate himself to teaching the art of MAGA to Trump's son (Barron or Don Jr., dealer's choice), who would then become the most powerful being in the country (president in Don Jr.'s case, or the world's tallest TikTok influencer in Barron's).

2060,DeSantis,2023-06-27,"""Pining For How Simple Life Was When Jesus Ruled and Mom Served Candy For Dinner""","Swaddled in sanctimony, bigotry and mawkish nostalgia for a time in America when white men ran everything, right-wing evangelical fabulists gathered this weekend at a Faith and Freedom confab to celebrate the ""privilege twins"" of Christian nationalism and white supremacy, the triumphant revoking of women's bodily autonomy, and their tawdry Jesus stand-in and cult leader, affirming, per Kari Lake, ""With God on our side, nothing can stop us from taking back this country."" Good God, save us. The ""nation's premier pro-faith, pro-family event,"" the Faith & Freedom Coalition's Road to Majority Conference was held over three fire-and-brimstone-and-bunkum days at the Washington Hilton. Coalition founder Ralph Reed opened the General Session by proudly noting that, thanks to SCOTUS hacks' junk jurisprudence, ""Roe v. Wade (is) in the ash heap of history where it belongs."" Reed also briefly addressed accusations the group has become ""a cult of personality around the former president."" Not so, he insisted: ""The truth (is) we are a cult of only one personality, (and) that is Jesus Christ of Nazareth who is our Lord and savior” - a reassuring message, indeed, to the rest of us godless heathens. Attendees wore ""Walk With Jesus"" caps, declared ""We do not co-parent with the government"" and ""Family is the greatest weapon known to mankind against tyranny,"" flocked to a book signing with Judge Jeanine, applauded godly wingnut Mike Huckabee for winning the Winston Churchill Lifetime Achievement Award, and attended an earlier anti-abortion rally at the Lincoln Memorial where Mike Pence decreed, “Save the babies, and we will save America."" We may have the principled, eloquent Schiff, Raskin, Sanders, AOC et al, but the predicants of Faith and Freedom summoned an impressive army of over 50 speakers, including almost a dozen GOP presidential candidates and the august likes of Hawley, Haley, Lake, D'Souza, Trey Gowdy, Ben Carson, Kayleigh McEnany, Tim Tebow, Oliver North, ""America's comic"" Brad Stine, the founder of Auntie Anne's Pretzels, Former Army officer Steve Russell, who wrote a book about the capture of Saddam Hussein titled ""We Got Him!"" and many other notables. ""It is so good to be in a room with happy, warrior, freedom fighters,” said Sen.Marcia Blackburn of the crowd. ""To those who believe there is no role for the unborn in Washington: You are wrong,” said Lindsey Graham. “We will restore sanity to this nation,"" said Ron DeSantis. ""This is a time to proudly put on the full armor of God."" In other words, notes Noah Berlatsky, it's time to reaffirm white Christian hegemony ""as righteous and natural,"" and Christians as a cultural group ""defined, not by belief or ethics of virtue, but by power."" ""The core truth of white Christianity is not the word of Jesus,"" he writes. ""It's that they believe, first and foremost, that they should rule."" Aptly if insanely, little wonder the event's keynote speaker was a twice-impeached, twice-divorced, multi-indicted, lying, babbling, philandering, Biblically illiterate, legally-liable- for-sexual-abuse, shameless, bonkers former ""president"" who's declaimed ""we have to bring religion back into our country"" though he doesn't even know how to hold a Bible, professed ""no president has ever fought for Christians as hard as I have"" though there's zero evidence except his vile appointment of enough SCOTUS zealots to obliterate women's right to choose, and laughably painted himself as a Christ-like victim whose enemies are God's as well. “I’m being indicted for you,” he told the devout crowd, calling each charge ""a badge of honor."" ""Together, we’re warriors in a righteous crusade to stop the arsonists, the atheists, globalists and Marxists."" In a 90-minute rant, he also vowed to ""keep foreign Christian-hating Communists (and Socialists) out of America."" Wild cheers for doing God's work. ""Our allegiance is to our country and our Creator,"" said Trump, who momentarily forgot Her name but did once try to fuck her. The stunningly bizarre alliance of the Christian right with an altogether loathsome human being, who's somehow often portrayed as crucial to God's redeeming of a sinful world, is at its core a soulless ""study in political opportunism,"" especially given an upcoming GOP presidential race where support from ""born-again pews and pulpits"" is considered a critical, if deeply dispiriting, factor. In a newly emboldened white Christian nationalist landscape - cue Lauren Boebert whining she’s ""tired of this separation of church and state junk"" - even the fringe, QAnon-themed ReAwaken America circus is moving into mainstream politics with a newly created Pastors For Trump, which plans to stump in swing states. At the Faith and Freedom synod, the surreal fact ""Trump is still king of the evangelical cattle call"" was questioned only by Chris Christie, who called out as ""a failure of leadership” a leader ""who never makes mistakes, who says that if something goes wrong, it’s everybody else’s fault, (but) when things go right, everything is to his credit...Our faith teaches us that people have to take responsibility for what they do."" He was met by thunderous boos.Reality, in short, is not the modern GOP's strong suit. Last week, fellow GOP cranks Marjie Greene and Elise Stefanik moved to expunge history itself with a resolution to disappear Trump's two impeachments for colluding with Russia and trying to overthrow democracy as a ""sham smear"" against Trump's ""good name,"" also Hunter Biden. Then the right started blaming ""wokeness"" for the Oceangate submersible disaster; they didn't even register the drowning deaths of 500 migrants enough to make up wacko stories about it, though the Onion - ""Coast Guard Sends Another Submersible Full of Billionaires After the First One"" - was on it, as were wise guys on Melon Husk's Twitter offering $250,000 sun exploration tours on a modified beeswax Cessna called The Icarus. Then Nikki Haley, who at the Faith/Freedom gig lauded an America ""strong and proud, not weak and woke,"" began wistfully reminiscing about an earlier, shining, no pain/ grief/ racism/ incest/suicide, imaginary America: ""Do you remember when you were growing up?"" she mused. ""Do you remember how simple life was, how easy it felt? It was about faith, family, and country. We can have that again, but to do that, we must vote Joe Biden out.""What the ever-loving fuck, said Americans who recalled what was going on around the time Haley was growing up in an apparent rose-colored bubble in South Carolina in the 1970s. The bitter end of a savage Vietnam War that killed millions of innocents, sparked bitter protests at home, gave rise to searing images like Nick Ut's heart-rending, history-changing photo of ""unspeakable evil"" - Kim Phúc, 9, screaming and running in terror from a napalm attack on her village of Trang Bang, her clothes burned off her. Cops and dogs viciously attacking black people - John Lewis was beaten to within an inch of his life - for seeking equal rights under the law. The grief, riots, devastation that followed the assassinations of Malcolm X, JFK, RFK, Martin Luther King. Kent State, Watergate, the '68 Democratic Convention, a country broken and bitterly divided. The president was a crook, marital rape was legal, colored drinking fountains endured, black people struggled to vote, a mob of 200 white supremacists in South Carolina attacked a school-bus filled with dozens of black children as scores of police stood and did nothing. Haley's tweet is ""a masterpiece of magical thinking"" from a woman who ""sees what she wants to see."" It exemplifies a party of magical thinking, of denial and obfuscation and revisionist history, of maudlin, self-serving glorification of a deeply unjust and often brutal past - Happy Days. Back to the (White) Future - in which white men held the power, and held tightly. When was America great, and for whom? Not for blacks, Jews, queers, women, immigrants, Muslims, Asians, brown or poor or Native or disabled or left-handed or left-thinking or in any way divergent people. The deliberate mischaracterizing of past or present - Trump's vision of American carnage, of marauding Mexican rapists, Marxist groomers and black trans vegan feminazis forcing children to read books about slavery and have gay sex - is a much-noted hallmark of fascism. A fictional (better) past was ruined by (inferior) ""others"" who must be blamed and put in their (powerless) place under a white, strict, theocratic, all-encompassing moral code. ""If you win, you need not have to explain,"" wrote Hitler. ""The victor will never be asked if he told the truth."" Nikki Haley, like the rest of her execrable party, likes to say it's time to ""tell the truth."" After her pathetic call back to ""how simple life was"" in a dreamy ""faith, family, and country"" America that only existed for a very few, many others brought some hard truth, like John Cleese on the parrot supposedly resting, stunned, or pining for the fjords: ""It has ceased to be - this is a late parrot."" ""Maybe you were not paying attention?"" suggested one. Another, ""Things seemed simpler when you were a child because you were a literal child."" Ted Lieu remembered ""when folks called me Chink. Threw eggs at our house. Slashed our tires. Called the police because they thought (we) were stealing wild ducks for food. And no one in government looked like me or you."" Jeff Sharlet recalled ""Nixon, Vietnam, every kid in my class terrified of nuclear annihilation, getting beat up for being a Jew."" Mrs. Betty Bowers said it best. ""Do you remember how simple life was, how easy it felt?"" she wrote. ""The sky was always blue. There were no winters or toothaches. Mom served us candy for dinner. Everyone got puppies. We can have that again, but we must first elect an angry fascist."" Badly burned Kim Phuc and other terrified Vietnamese children run from a napalm attack in1972, when Nikki Haley recalls ""how simple life was.""

Florida campaign finance records show that from 2018 to 2022, ECN Capital gave over $100,000 in foreign national contributions to state political committees. Recipients of this funding include the past two gubernatorial campaigns for Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, in addition to Friends of Ron DeSantis, the state-level PAC that illegally transferred $82.5 million in soft money — money that isn’t subject to federal campaign finance laws — to Never Back Down, a federal super PAC supporting DeSantis’s current presidential bid.“The recent, unprecedented rise of ‘soft money’ in federal elections undermines the crucial campaign finance laws that exist to uphold transparency, combat corruption, and safeguard the electoral process,” said Saurav Ghosh, director of federal campaign finance reform at Campaign Legal Center. “As this complaint shows, foreign money may already be influencing the 2024 presidential election, which obviously undermines voters’ ability to trust that the electoral process and their government are truly serving their interests.”For decades, the Federal Election Campaign Act (FECA) has prohibited foreign nationals – foreign corporations included – from making contributions in connection with any local, state, or federal elections. Foreign nationals are also prohibited from participating in a decision-making processes related to making political contributions.U.S.-registered subsidiaries of ECN Capital also made contributions to federal and state elections totaling over $122,000 in this same four-year period. Given that ECN Capital’s subsidiaries appear to exist only on paper, ECN Capital’s officers — several of whom appear to be Canadian nationals — most likely participated in decision-making around this group of contributions, such that the contributions from the U.S.-based subsidiaries also violated federal campaign finance laws.The FEC has taken action in the recent past on illegal foreign contributions, even in an era that has seen the Commission regularly fail to uphold the law. As the sole government agency tasked with enforcing federal campaign finance law, enforcing the prohibitions against foreign influence are an important part of the FEC’s mission.The FEC should investigate this political spending by ECN Capitol and take appropriate action to uphold and enforce the law.",Common Dreams,Business,Yes,23.563236555572523,98.89038383206808,99.6446502903265,43.96596255820521,65.10365181668546,53.57697359270068,campaign legal,"{'corporation': 'canadian', 'contributions': 'illegal'}","{'campaign': 'federal', 'laws': 'federal', 'contributions': 'foreign', 'committees': 'political', 'campaigns': 'gubernatorial', 'money': 'foreign', 'bid': 'presidential', 'rise': 'unprecedented', 'elections': 'federal', 'process': 'electoral', 'reform': 'federal', 'election': 'presidential', 'nationals': 'canadian', 'corporations': 'foreign', 'period': 'same', 'subsidiaries': 'u.s.-based', 'past': 'recent', 'agency': 'sole', 'law': 'federal', 'influence': 'foreign', 'part': 'important', 'spending': 'political', 'action': 'appropriate'}",0,1

Latest proof the GOP is truly a malignant flaming clown car: A new, screechy, homophobic campaign ad by hateful “faulty robot from Westworld"" and presidential hopeful Ron DeSantis that's either the gayest or most bonkers ad ever. It attacks Trump as (eww) queer-friendly before pivoting to manly-man Ron doing his loud fake laugh amidst oiled bodybuilders, drag queens, disco music, Nazi music, gladiators, more bodybuilders, Brad Pitt's Achilles and Christian Bale's psychopath. Yeah, we're confused too.Even before this latest Hindenburg of an ad in a supposed presidential campaign that more accurately resembles a ""teenage, you know, food fight,"" DeSantis had proved himself ""an awkward, odd, cringey meatball of a man"" with ""the charisma of a gasoline-soaked mushroom."" There was the ""buzzword diarrhea"" speech in South Carolina where, evidently attempting to channel Winston Churchill, he managed to use ""woke"" seven times in 20 seconds: “We fight the woke in the schools. We fight the woke in the legislature. We fight the woke in the corporations...We will never ever surrender to the woke mob."" There were the ""saucy little white boots,"" the wide-eyed bobblehead in Japan, the first demented fake laugh, the second, worse one, and the growing sense DeSantis is not just a bigoted, bullying, aspiring Fascist, raging egomaniac and tacky showboater with the emotional maturity of a middle-schooler who never met a vulnerable segment of the population he didn't hate and want to hurt in the dubious name of out-Trumping Trump, but also just a weird, icky dude.So sure, to mark the last day of Pride Month his ""War Room"" released an anti-Trump, anti-LGBTQ+ ad so stupid, so vile, so filled with ""the self-parodying crapitude of the DeSantis camp"" that it was swiftly deemed ""the gayest ad in the history of political advertising,"" ""a terrific ad for Democrats,"" or ""the worst video I have ever seen in my life."" It starts with Trump expressing tepid support for the queer community after the Pulse Nightclub shootings - nah, let's just gun 'em down - before veering to a proud montage of news stories about tough guy DeSantis' don't-say-gay madness and “harshest, most draconian laws that literally threaten trans existence."" To a bizarre mix of gay club disco tracks and ominous marching music, we see DeSantis alternately cackling and shooting lightning from his eyes - Dark Brandon Redux - with quick-cut homoerotic images of half-naked muscle-men, flamboyant drag queens, gladiators, warriors, American Psycho, more beefcakes seemingly prepping for Tucker's testicle-tanning, and yes all this from a guy who wants to be - checks notes - elected president of the country.Apart from the WTF weirdness, of course, critics cited the over-the-top homophobia, the ""edgelordian way it leans into fascism's omnipresent obsession with hyper-masculinity,"" the ""eliminationist rhetoric"" about a small, marginalized, acutely vulnerable population and the evident wish to, in the words of openly gay Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg, ""make life hardest for a community that's already one of the hardest hit in America."" Asked about the ad on CNN, he tried to ""leave aside the strangeness of trying to prove your manhood by putting up a video that splices images of you between oiled-up, shirtless bodybuilders” to focus on the ugly, baleful bottom line: This hateful, deranged cracker ""has absolutely nothing to offer us or our country."" ""Who are you trying to help?"" he asked. ""Who are you trying to make better off? And what public policy problems do you get up in the morning thinking about how to solve?""

Entirely made up of women over the age of 60, a few considerably older, the dancers perform on flatbed trucks in parades and retirement homes, community centres and private events in order to raise funds for Southeastern Guide Dogs, an organisation that trains guide dogs for veterans and other visually impaired people. Dressed in homemade, leg-revealing spandex and sparkle-festooned outfits that variously suggest unicorns or “patriotic reindeer” at Christmas time, the women perform dance sequences set to an eclectic selection of tunes, from Harry Belafonte’s Jump in the Line (Shake, Señora) and Everybody by the Backstreet Boys, to drone-forward EDM composed by Martinsen himself. There is, in fact, a scene where the women seem to break into a tightly planned routine (choreographed by Loohufvud) in the middle of loading the car, which adds a mild surreality to the proceedings.As the film goes along, we get to know some of the women on a more personal level although the film-makers have chosen not to use any identifying subtitles to help track who’s who, as is often the fashion these days with documentaries. Still, it’s not hard to work out that Katherine Hardy Shortlidge is the main motivating troupe leader, a former cop who spent years undercover in the vice squad, who had found a new purpose in marshalling her dancers between rehearsals and performances. Another subject who gets prominent coverage is Nancy Miller, a woman still doing a physically challenging outdoor 9-to-5 job but who finds herself increasingly challenged to keep up due to a serious gastrointestinal condition that drains her health. A third woman bridles against a controlling husband who doesn’t want her diverting her energy away from him and their home; yet another, perhaps the most intriguing of all, is a former prisoner with a twangy southern accent, a massive Rottweiler and a butch fashion sense who works the troupe’s iPod.

Back in February, ATTR organized and arranged transportation via private jet on behalf of Governor DeSantis to almost a dozen speaking engagements in at least eight states. The exact cost for these flights is currently unknown. The Florida Commission on Ethics requires state government officials to report any travel gifts over $100 – a threshold that private jet travel easily meets - within the last day of each calendar quarter. Governor DeSantis had up until Friday, June 30 to disclose ATTR’s travel gifts. No gift disclosure statement from the governor is on the Commission’s website as of July 5th of this year. “This lack of disclosure from Governor DeSantis appears to be a clear violation of state laws that are necessary to maintaining public trust,” said Kedric Payne, CLC Vice President, General Counsel, and Senior Director of Ethics. “Floridians have a right to know that government officials representing them are acting in the public’s interests – not their own personal interest, or the interests of the wealthy special interests who give them gifts. The Florida Commission on Ethics must investigate whether Governor DeSantis did, in fact, omit travel gifts from ATTR from his financial disclosure form and take appropriate action.” ATTR has acknowledged that travel arrangements made by the nonprofit on behalf of Governor DeSantis were not a political contribution. No publicly available evidence indicates that these trips were related to his official role as Florida’s governor but one trip was on a jet owned by Jeffrey Soffer – a Miami hotelier hoping to get Florida’s gambling laws changed – for a speaking event in New York City.

Rendon/The Daily Beast/Cara RobbinsIn 2006, Andrew Rannells was 26, although his youthful looks made him, as he puts it, “a Broadway 18.” He had been starring in the hit musical Hairspray as Link Larkin for eight months—his first lead role on Broadway. Then one of the producers came to see him. In his just-published book of personal essays, Uncle of the Year & Other Debatable Triumphs, he recalls the producer saying, “We are not going to renew your contract next month. We are bringing in a great young guy from the national tour named Aaron Tveit. You would love him. He’s like you but younger and straight.”“The politics of any small-town community theater are ultimately the same politics you find on Broadway, and honestly any workplace,” Rannells, now 44, told The Daily Beast. “It’s the same characters everywhere. But I remember sitting there and thinking, ‘Holy shit, this is what’s happening to me right now. I’m being let go for a younger, straighter version of me?’ And, by the way, I was 26!” He laughed. “The show business is always very humbling. There are new ways every day to have your feelings hurt if you let it. People are often well-meaning but don’t know how to communicate properly. You figure out how to roll with it.“If I was faced with the same situation at 44 as I was at 27 I would speak up to that person, and say, ‘Look, I am not going to sue you. But just so you know, what you said was super offensive and probably illegal according to employment laws. So please don’t speak to me like that.’ At that age, I thought that producer was really powerful. Years later, I was working with an amazing actor, Dick Latessa, who sadly passed away in 2016. I told him about a director who had threatened to ruin my career, and that I would never work again. I was very shaken by it. Dick said that the next time I see that person, to look them in the face, and say, ‘Fuck you, there’s a lot of people I can work with.’ And he was right.”Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,No,23.2651867528712,47.49412985689185,99.9795341466085,42.62853230955604,21.52794318916947,54.396894454106025,andrew rannells,{},"{'looks': 'youthful', 'role': 'first', 'book': 'published', 'essays': 'personal', 'month': 'next', 'guy': 'young', 'tour': 'national', 'town': 'small', 'politics': 'same', 'characters': 'same', 'shit': 'holy', 'version': 'straighter', 'ways': 'new', 'situation': 'same', 'actor': 'amazing', 'time': 'next', '”read': 'more'}",0,0
2444,DeSantis,2023-07-08,"""The Serial Killer Who Preyed Upon Gay New Yorkers""","Courtesy of HBOLast Call: When a Serial Killer Stalked Queer New York is yet another disturbing true-crime documentary about a fiend preying upon a marginalized community. However, the compelling hook of Anthony Caronna and Howard Gertler’s four-part HBO investigation (July 9) is that it’s both a whodunit and a sociological critique of the era and environment in which its tale took place: early 1990s New York City, whose climate of homophobia facilitated its villain’s homicides. With anti-gay and trans legislation currently sweeping the nation, it’s an all-too-relevant story about persecution and violence, and the way in which public rhetoric—and inaction—fosters further hate.Director Caronna’s series begins with the 1992 discovery by maintenance workers of a dismembered body in Burlington County, New Jersey. Cut into seven pieces, each of them wrapped in newspaper (and a shower curtain) and packed into different trash bags, this individual was—via his briefcase and personal belongings—swiftly identified as Thomas Mulcahy, a 57-year-old husband and father who was in the area for a business meeting. Detectives also found latex gloves, a compass saw, and a linen sheet in the plastic bags, one of which was eventually traced back to Staten Island’s lone CVS. Otherwise, however, there was little useful physical evidence procured from these items, so cops shifted their attention to Mulcahy’s movements in the days and hours leading up to his murder.As they soon learned, Mulcahy had last been seen on July 8, 1992, at midtown Manhattan’s Townhouse Bar, an upscale gay watering hole where older well-to-do gentlemen often met younger suitors. Douglas Gibson remembers talking to Mulcahy that evening and spying an unknown man in his vicinity, but he didn’t get a good enough look at this stranger to provide an actual description. Cops, meanwhile, found it difficult to convince people in and around this establishment to talk to them, since in 1992, the relationship between the police and the gay community was defined by distrust, if not outright antipathy, much of it born from the former’s history of prejudiced harassment and hostility.

""If we don’t win this election, we won’t have a country."" Happily envisaging when ""we"" are elected, he said of his purported enemies, “Their reign will be over and America will be a free nation once again.” The crowd cheered; one person called out, ""Save us.""

Under Trump's reign, the economy lost 3 million jobs, the number of uninsured rose 3 million, the trade deficit rose 40%, the federal debt rose to an astronomical $21.6 trillion, the rich got richer (and the poor...), he abandoned peace treaties with Iran and Russia, flubbed one with N. Korea, withdrew from the Paris climate deal, started a trade war with China, tried to overthrow democracy and oh yeah - over a million COVID deaths, 40% preventable. Facts, people. Now they want him to ""save us?""

And don't get us started on pernicious crayons. Also Lenin, that hippie who wrote Imagine. We can't even.Still - markers be damned - the right is boldly confronting the vital issues of the day. In Texas, which is seeing historic 120-degree days and a spike of heat-related deaths, the GOP continued its streak of performative evil by banning local ordinances requiring water breaks for (often brown) workers laboring outside. In Oklahoma, the new evangelical school superintendent, who's proposed teaching ""Western heritage"" in all classes and called the teachers' union a ""terrorist organization,"" told a forum the Tulsa Race Massacre doesn't fall under a CRT ban because, ""Let’s not (say) the skin color determined that."" In Tennessee, GOP Rep. Andy Ogles posted a cheerful, dystopian video wishing constituents a happy 4th: ""Look, the left is trying to destroy our country and our family and they're coming after you...Have a blessed 4th of July!"" Back in Iowa, Trump ended his anti-Marxist diatribe by visiting a Dairy Queen, telling workers to ""take care of the people"" and ordering blizzards all around - but only after having to ask what it is.

2504,DeSantis,2023-07-10,"""‘Blonde hairs on display’: Biden’s beach bod, attire divides the internet""","President Joe Biden wore swim shorts while lounging at a beach in Delaware on Saturday, a seemingly unimportant event that has somehow become the latest political mini-drama. Ahead of a planned five-day trip to Europe, Biden and his wife Jill visited Rehoboth Beach with the Secret Service where the pair sat under umbrellas. Yet given the current state of domestic discourse, countless people from across the political spectrum used the photos to either condemn or defend Biden. Democrats were quick to praise the 80-year-old president as hip and cool for his choice of attire, which included shorts imprinted with images of turtles. ""Dang. This photo of President Biden wearing sea turtle shorts is pretty cool honestly,"" Victor Shi wrote. ""80 year olds can be pretty cool too."" ""if he keeps leaning into the frat guy energy it will be a landslide,"" wrote one user. Conservatives on the other hand described the photographs as disgusting, vile, and tasteless. Over at the blog for far-right commentator Steven Crowder, one writer was especially critical of the president's swimwear. ""There is no way you can like and respect Joe Biden and allow him to go shirtless in a public place in turtle shorts,"" the post says. ""Either that or the person who suggested 'Hey Mr. President, let's go to the beach' should be blacklisted from ever working in politics again."" Other more conspiratorial users suggested that the praise for Biden was part of a coordinated effort to make the elder statesman more palatable for voters. ""All these paid lib extremists come out in unison yesterday… 'Look at that strength… look at Biden in those shorts on the beach… such strength… he’s in much better shape than Trump…'"" they wrote. ""The man doesn’t even know where the hell he is."" https://twitter.com/sues86453/status/1678371802802782211?s=20 https://twitter.com/ms_babyrussell/status/1677848633578799104?s=20 A handful of users, however, saw the entire debate as meaningless. One self-described leftist pointed to ongoing economic issues as being much more concerning than Biden's attire. ""'Doesn’t Biden look good in shorts?' The minimum wage is still $7.25 and we don’t even get to have a real primary,"" they wrote. https://twitter.com/OrangeFreddyG/status/1678190018072903681?s=20 https://twitter.com/matthewdmarsden/status/1678217527808106498?s=20 Some online even went as far as to compare Biden, former President Donald Trump, and Gov. Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.) in regards to who wore shorts better. ""Um yea... Biden's shorts win,"" one user argued. With the presidential election season nearing, Americans, consumed by terror over a potential reign from their political foe, are becoming increasingly desperate in their support or defense of Biden and Trump.

2505,DeSantis,2023-07-10,"""‘Crossed the line’: String of anti-gay ads from DeSantis force Trump supporters to flip on LGBTQ support""","Opponents of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) are rebuking mailers sent to Iowa households that boasted about former President Donald Trump's LGBTQ+ record. The Iowa mailers do not appear to be sent from the DeSantis campaign, however, they follow a recent string of pro-DeSantis ads that seek to portray Trump as being vehemently pro-gay and transgender rights. The recent mailers thank Trump for standing up for LGBTQ+ rights and note that he ""celebrated gay marriage victory at Mar-a-Lago Party with Log Cabin Republicans,"" a Republican organization that advocates for LGBT rights. They also dubbed Trump a ""transgender trailblazer"" in reference to his decision to allow transgender model Jenna Talackova to compete in a Miss Universe competition when he owned the pageant. Right-wing commentator Mike Cernovich shared images of the ""'attack ad' DeSantis supporters are running in Iowa against Trump,"" adding, ""I don't get it, truly I don't see the winning play here."" https://twitter.com/Cernovich/status/1678260001675284480 Laura Loomer, a far-right activist and vocal Trump supporter, said the DeSantis campaign was ""desperate"" and employing ""a dirty trick that won't work."" ""Republicans don’t hate gay people. Ron DeSantis is out of touch,"" she added. https://twitter.com/LauraLoomer/status/1678380833969692672 ""It should be obvious to everyone at this point that DeSantis has crossed the line from channeling legitimate cultural grievances to weaponizing bigotry,"" commented another user. https://twitter.com/jeffgiesea/status/1678358205389217793 The mailers, however, were not sent from the DeSantis campaign itself, as they lack a disclaimer that they were paid for by it, a mandatory requirement by the Federal Election Commission for any public communications made by a political committee. The mailers instead state that they were paid for by Advancing Our Values, an organization that first registered as a 504 non-profit in Iowa on June 27. The listed registered agent for the organization is Cogency Global Inc., which provides registered agent services nationwide. The Florida-based Moms for Liberty Foundation uses Cogency Global as its registered agent as well, state records show. Some DeSantis supporters allege the mailers were a product of progressive lobbyists, as the address listed for Advancing Our Values was at one point listed as an address for Iowa Voices, a healthcare-focused offshoot of the progressive organization Iowa Forward. However, both Iowa Voices and Iowa Forward appear to have ceased activities as of 2020. The DeSantis campaign did not immediately respond to the Daily Dot's request for comment about whether the campaign had any affiliation with the mailers. Cernovich followed up in a later tweet saying that the mailers are ""so counter productive that DeSantis supporters are saying it’s not from any group backing him."" ""Imagine playing that stupid,"" Cernovich continued. ""Own the ad if you endorse the message. Don’t be cowards."" Regardless of whether the mailers did not originate from DeSantis' campaign, they follow a similar line of attack by the DeSantis campaign. One ad released by the pro-DeSantis political action committee Never Back Down two weeks ago also hit at Trump for allowing Talackova to compete in his Miss Universe competition. And a separate video put out on June 30 by DeSantis' social media team similarly invoked Trump's past supportive comments toward LGBTQ+ rights. It has since been deleted by the original poster. Although that ad faced swift backlash and was ultimately deleted, DeSantis defended its premise in an interview last week. “I think that’s totally fair game because he’s now campaigning, saying the opposite, that he doesn’t think that you should have men competing in women’s things like athletics,” DeSantis said. A RealClearPolitics average of recent polls shows Trump leading DeSantis by 24 points on average in Iowa, where the Republican caucuses are set to kick off.

Subscribe here and send your questions, tips, and complaints here.EXCLUSIVE — FOX’S MAGA YOUTH BREAK-UP: Months after fully severing ties with CPAC, Fox News appears to have distanced itself from another major conservative powerhouse: Turning Point USA. In years past, the cable network maintained a close, nearly symbiotic relationship with the Charlie Kirk-led MAGA student group, with Fox News stars regularly appearing at TPUSA events and Fox Nation livestreaming the entirety of the org’s Student Action Summit and Americafest events, including an All Access Live broadcast in 2021 hosted by Fox stars Kayleigh McEnany and Pete Hegseth. However, as Kirk unveils his big 2023 confab for this upcoming weekend, Fox News is notably absent from the speakers roster, has done no advance hyping of the event, and will not be live-streaming it. “Fox’s relationship with Turning Point is basically over,” a Fox News insider told Confider. “They don’t want their talent associated with them anymore.” The inaugural Turning Point Action Conference, aka ActCon, which is hosted by TPUSA’s political advocacy arm and begins Saturday in Palm Beach, will feature a bevy of GOP presidential candidates and lawmakers along with right-wing pundits, including former Fox News hosts Tucker Carlson and Dan Bongino, both of whom exited the network in April. But not a single Fox News star is set to appear at this moment. Fox News, like any cable network, could very well cover a moment or two from the event should it warrant their attention, but the network’s absence constitutes a remarkable change for both parties: Over the past two years, Turning Point’s biggest annual events have been Fox-heavy affairs featuring the Hegseth and McEnany broadcasts as well as much-hyped speeches from Carlson, Jesse Watters, Greg Gutfeld, Jeanine Pirro, and Laura Ingraham. (Ingraham was the only Fox personality to speak at TPUSA’s women’s summit last month, but the group did not actively promote her speech on its website.) So what’s behind the network apparently ghosting Turning Point? Semafor reported last week that the network is wary about letting its stars appear at conservative events with known election deniers and conspiracy theorists in the wake of Fox’s massive $787.5-million settlement with Dominion. For example, Fox has discouraged Pirro, who was prominently named in the Dominion lawsuit, from speaking at a TPUSA event and a church service to promote her latest book. Further suggesting a link between Dominion and Fox’s break-up with TPUSA is the fact that ActCon 2023’s keynote speaker is Donald Trump, whose election lies directly led to Fox’s Dominion mess. (Trump will appear this weekend on Fox’s air, however, in a more controlled environment, via a sitdown interview with Maria Bartiromo.) Other 2020 deniers and Jan. 6 organizers scheduled for ActCon speeches include Mike Lindell, Patrick Byrne, and Steve Bannon. Furthermore, Kirk himself has been outspoken in his belief that the 2020 vote was “stolen“ from Trump. Neither Fox News nor TPUSA responded to requests for comment.Tips?

The lawsuit focuses on the provisions outlined in Section 10 of the law, which criminalizes the transportation of individuals into Florida who may have entered the country unlawfully and have not been “inspected” by the federal government since. The complaint states that it is unconstitutional for a state to unilaterally regulate federal immigration and subject people to criminal punishment without fair notice and that Florida’s use of the term “inspection” is incoherent and unconstitutionally vague.The case was filed against Gov. Ron DeSantis, Attorney General Ashley Moody, Florida Statewide Prosecutor Nicholas B. Cox and the attorneys general for all 20 Florida Judicial Circuits, on behalf of the Farmworker Association of Florida and various impacted individuals, including U.S. citizens and undocumented drivers and passengers who routinely travel into and out of Florida.Section 10 is only one of a host of new laws within SB 1718 that harm Florida immigrants and their families and seeks to target and intimidate immigrant families in every facet of their lives. The law inhibits and intimidates immigrant Floridians seeking health care, expands E-Verify requirements and penalties on businesses, prohibits local government funding of new community identification cards, and invalidates certain driver’s licenses from states like Connecticut, Vermont, Delaware and Hawaii. The lawsuit was filed in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami.The complaint can be found here.The following comments are from:Paul R. Chavez, senior supervising attorney with the Southern Poverty Law Center’s Immigrant Justice Project: “This harmful anti-immigrant bill is unconstitutional, xenophobic and will increase the unlawful racial profiling of Florida’s Black and Brown communities. Admittedly designed to inflict cruelty, SB 1718 is unconstitutional and undermines our democracy. This lawsuit will vindicate all of our constitutional rights, and we remain committed to ensuring that immigrants are treated fairly, equally and with dignity. Such an ugly attack on our immigrant community will not stand.”Amien Kacou, staff attorney for the ACLU of Florida: “As news of the predictable damage inflicted on Florida by SB 1718 comes in, we are filing this lawsuit to stop its unconstitutional criminalization of the immigrant community in a state where one-fifth of the population was born abroad. This legislation is not the solution to any problem. It is an attempt to scapegoat and terrorize vulnerable families and workers already burdened by the difficulty of the federal immigration process and to pick a fight with the federal government in order to serve the ambitions of a few politicians. Our challenge aims to uphold the Constitution and protect our communities from the rising threat of discrimination posed by this new Florida law.”Evelyn Wiese, litigation attorney with Americans for Immigrant Justice:“SB 1718 is an attack on Florida’s immigrant community and on the rights of all Floridians, who count immigrants among their family members, neighbors, coworkers and friends. By making it a felony for anyone to travel into the state with immigrants who fall into a broad and not-clearly-defined category, Section 10 is both extreme and unconstitutional. There’s no denying the viciousness and inhumanity of this xenophobic new law. But Governor DeSantis and his anti-immigrant allies in the Florida Legislature should make no mistake: when they attempt to flout the Constitution, we will fight back. Florida has a long and proud history of welcoming immigrants into the state. Now, we are proud to stand with members of Florida’s immigrant community in fighting to protect their — and all Floridians’ — constitutional rights.” Kate Melloy Goettel, legal director of litigation at the American Immigration Council:“Florida's attempt to regulate federal immigration law violates the rights and dignity of all individuals in the state and harms immigrant families. Criminalizing transportation without federal 'inspection' and subjecting individuals to vague definitions is both unconstitutional and unfair. This ill-advised legislation not only singles out immigrants and their families but also poses a threat to the social and economic well-being of Florida's communities. We stand firm in our commitment to uphold the rights and dignity of every individual in the state, regardless of their immigration status. Unity and fairness must triumph over fear and hostility.” Nezahualcoyotl Xiuhtecutli, PhD, general coordinator, Farmworker Association of Florida, Inc.: “FWAF is proud to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with our 12,000 members to challenge this hateful law. Not only is this law detrimental to our members’ abilities to put food on their own tables, it is detrimental to our members’ ability to put food on everyone’s tables. Florida’s SB 1718 is a self-inflicted wound — the product of short-sighted lawmakers unable to see beyond the most immediate political opportunity. Though the impact of similar anti-immigrant laws in Arizona, Alabama and Georgia clearly foreshadowed its legal and economic fallout, SB 1718 was passed with little regard for the hardships those states have experienced.” Individual Plaintiff 1 MM: “I’m suing because this law harms our family and many others. We aren’t doing anything to hurt anyone. On the contrary, we’re here working, paying taxes and trying to provide a safe life for our families. Now we’re scared to even travel together as a family. I would never want my son to face a felony for traveling with his mother and his sister. It makes no sense. We’re family — how can this be?”",Common Dreams,Top,Yes,20.535722384435275,97.54255861216834,99.97385713832504,30.380685889692728,65.37472873597792,38.58490290262419,civil rights,{},"{'organizations': 'legal', 'lawsuit': 'federal', 'law': 'hateful', 'government': 'federal', 'immigration': 'federal', 'punishment': 'criminal', 'notice': 'fair', 'individuals': 'subjecting', 'drivers': 'undocumented', 'laws': 'immigrant', 'families': 'immigrant', 'requirements': 'verify', 'funding': 'local', 'cards': 'new', 'driver': 'certain', 'comments': 'following', 'attorney': 'supervising', 'bill': 'immigrant', 'profiling': 'racial', 'communities': 'black', 'rights': 'constitutional', 'attack': 'ugly', 'community': 'immigrant', 'damage': 'predictable', 'criminalization': 'unconstitutional', 'process': 'federal', 'politicians': 'few', 'threat': 'rising', 'category': 'broad', 'allies': 'immigrant', 'history': 'long', 'director': 'legal', 'transportation': 'criminalizing', 'inspection': 'federal', 'definitions': 'vague', 'legislation': 'advised', 'being': 'social', 'coordinator': 'general', 'tables': 'own', 'wound': 'inflicted', 'lawmakers': 'unable', 'opportunity': 'political', 'fallout': 'legal', 'regard': 'little', 'others': 'many', 'life': 'safe'}",0,0

Ron DeSantis (R) stoked controversy after his campaign promoted an ad in late June that attacked former President Donald Trump's past support of the LGBTQ+ community. The original poster deleted the video, however, the DeSantis War Room account's tweet sharing it is still up. https://twitter.com/DeSantisWarRoom/status/1674899610379116546 The controversial video showed Trump saying he would “do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens” and highlighted his decision to allow a transgender model to compete in a Miss Universe competition when he owned the pageant, in contrast to DeSantis' recent record, which he is using to run against Trump from the right in the 2024 Republican party. The video included a critic calling DeSantis' laws restricting transgender rights as ""draconian."" The Florida governor has signed a slew of anti-trans bills, including a ban gender-affirming care for minors, a ban on children attending drag shows, and school curriculum reforms restricting the inclusion of LGBTQ themes. It also compared DeSantis favorably to fictional serial killer Patrick Bateman. But the video didn't come from a DeSantis fan outside of the campaign as the initial post may have indicated and fans of DeSantis implied as outrage grew. Instead, according to a New York Times report published Sunday, that video was actually ""more of a self-inflicted wound than was previously known."" ""A DeSantis campaign aide had originally produced the video internally, passing it off to an outside supporter to post it first and making it appear as if it was generated independently, according to a person with knowledge of the incident,"" the Times reported. Despite receiving criticism from both sides of aisle, DeSantis defended the premise of the video as ""totally fair game,"" arguing that Trump has flip flopped on LGBTQ-related issues. The video also sparked consternation within DeSantis' anti-trans coalition. After it ran, prominent members of the pro-DeSantis' organization Gays Against Groomers said they would leave the group. The Florida governor has consistently trailed Trump in Republican primary polls. A survey conducted in mid-July shows Trump leading DeSantis by 26 points.

Ron DeSantis (R) is being accused of retweeting a video showing the Florida governor surrounded by a Nazi symbol. The video, which was originally shared and later deleted by a DeSantis fan account, shows troops marching towards the conservative politician as Florida's flag and a sunwheel are visible in the background. https://twitter.com/ltthompso/status/1683126870106144769?s=20 The sunwheel, also known as the sonnenrad, is an ancient European symbol that was appropriated by the Nazis. The imagery is also used by a multitude of far-right groups operating today. ""The @desantiscams account just deleted this video after at least one campaign staffer RT'd it,"" podcast host Luke Thompson wrote after sharing a copy of the video. ""I wonder if this was also made in-house."" A screenshot of a reply to the tweet included the handle of the staffer, indicating that the staffer retweeted it. Thompson's remark also points to an incident several weeks ago in which the DeSantis campaign promoted another video that criticized former President Donald Trump for at times supporting the LGBTQ community. As reported by the New York Times on Sunday, the video, which had been passed off as being produced by a fan, had actually been developed in-house by a DeSantis staffer. At this time, there is no evidence indicating that the latest video showing Nazi imagery was made by anyone connected to the DeSantis campaign. Neither the staffer alleged to have retweeted the video or the campaign itself have commented on the tweet. Aside from the sonnenrad, the video focuses largely on celebrating DeSantis for his opposition to the LGBTQ community and criticizing Trump for failing to put up a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. The DeSantis fan account that originally shared the footage on Twitter, known as Ron DeSantis Fancams, has not tweeted since deleting the video. The incident is not the first time that the DeSantis campaign has been linked to those espousing Nazi beliefs. Earlier this year, the campaign hired a speechwriter who has openly praised white nationalist Nick Fuentes.

3244,DeSantis,2023-07-27,"""‘Did Kamala Harris write this?’: DeSantis team targets Black GOP congressman who slightly criticized Florida’s new African-American history standards""","Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis' (R) campaign went after a conservative congressman from his state after he criticized an aspect of the state's new African American history standards. Vice President Kamala Harris and other critics have painted the new guidelines as ""revisionist history,"" and opposed the inclusion of language stating that slaves learned specialized skills, ""which, in some instances, could be applied for their personal benefit."" ""Adults know what slavery really involved. It involved rape. It involved torture. It involved taking a baby from their mother,"" Harris said last week. She later added: ""How is it that anyone could suggest that, in the midst of these atrocities, that there was any benefit to being subjected to this level of dehumanization?"" Rep. Byron Donalds (R-Fla.), a member of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, similarly criticized the language about slaves learning skills that could benefit them, but called the new standards overall ""good, robust & accurate."" ""That being said, the attempt to feature the personal benefits of slavery is wrong & needs to be adjusted,"" Donalds tweeted Sunday. ""That obviously wasn't the goal & I have faith that FLDOE will correct this."" https://twitter.com/RepDonaldsPress/status/1684199331505504256 Donalds' tweet drew immediate backlash from the DeSantis campaign. ""Did Kamala Harris write this tweet?"" wrote DeSantis' rapid response director Christina Pushaw. ""Supposed conservatives in the federal government are pushing the same false narrative that originated from the White House,"" wrote DeSantis' press secretary, Jeremy Redfern. ""Florida isn’t going to hide the truth for political convenience. Maybe the congressman shouldn’t swing for the liberal media fences like [Harris]."" Redfern noted in a separate tweet that the College Board's Advanced Placement African American Studies course (which Florida originally rejected over concerns about critical race theory) also contained language about former slaves using skills they learned ""to provide for themselves and others."" https://twitter.com/JeremyRedfernFL/status/1684369870031290368 https://twitter.com/JeremyRedfernFL/status/1684377821508956163 Donalds responded to the backlash from DeSantis' camp Wednesday night, saying that ""anyone who can't accurately interpret what I said is disingenuous and is desperately attempting to score political points."" ""What's crazy to me is I expressed support for the vast majority of the new African American history standards and happened to oppose one sentence that seemed to dignify the skills gained by slaves as a result of their enslavement,"" Donalds wrote. https://twitter.com/ByronDonalds/status/1684361013766881281 Donalds then went on to reiterate his March endorsement of former President Donald Trump over his home state governor for the 2024 presidential election, though the two-term congressman has avoided directly criticizing DeSantis. In April, Donalds said that while DeSantis is ""the best [governor] in the country,"" Trump is ""the guy that can get the job done on day one"" on the economy, immigration, and foreign policy. A poll conducted by Marquette Law School from July 7-12 found that Trump holds a 24-point lead over DeSantis for the Republican nomination—up 19 points since March, before DeSantis entered the race. However, the same poll found that registered voters slightly favored DeSantis over Trump in a hypothetical head-to-head match-up against Biden. Those surveyed were evenly split when asked about a rematch between Biden and Trump, but preferred DeSantis to Biden 51-48.

Ron DeSantis' (R-Fla.) team 2024 confirmed on Tuesday that staffer Nate Hochman was no longer with the campaign. The report comes after Hochman retweeted a video that featured DeSantis' face in a Nazi symbol. The campaign later revealed that Hochman created the video, then distributed it to an unaffiliated Twitter account in an attempt to launder the video into the mainstream. Hochman's dismissal came amid a larger shakeup on Team DeSantis, with reports saying the campaign let at least a third of its staffers go. While there's no proof that Hochman was fired because of the video (although it's safe for one to assume), people are nonetheless rising to Hochman's defense, claiming it was clearly an innocent mistake. The video used a sonnenrad, which is a lesser-known symbol of the Third Reich. While obscure, the symbol has become prominent in far-right circles. And there's no doubt that Hochman was ingrained in far-right circles. Prior to joining the DeSantis team, he praised Nick Fuentes, one of the nation's most avowed pro-Hitler voices. Fuentes has repeatedly denied the Holocaust and shared his support for Nazi Germany. That Hochman might be unaware he was a fan of a Nazi sympathizer and also might make a Nazi video unintentionally, just two mere Hitler-adjacent coincidences, seems dubious at best. Still, people on the right are jumping to his defense. Inez Stepman, a writer for the Federalist, tweeted that Hochman said is ""obviously not a Nazi."" ""Nate aside, I’m not going to participate in any of these stupid pearl-clutching 2 mins hate moments on the right,"" she wrote. ""Wake me up when nazis have 1/100th of the power of a woke gaggle of undergrads in America."" While it's true the Nazi movement may not be as prevalent in America as progressives, there's no doubt it has nascent strains in the American far-right, especially given how many of them seem to crack Holocaust jokes. In response to someone noting that far-right mass shooters have come to embrace the sonnenrad symbol, pundit Ryan Girdusky said the conversation around the issue is ""stupid."" ""I don’t spend hours a day looking up Nazi propaganda. I guarantee most people don’t. I know Nate Hochman, he’s not a Nazi. Trying to frame him as one is a lie,"" he wrote. ""He’s a stupid zoomer who thought it was a hype video."" There's no denying the fascist aesthetic of the video, though, which included troops marching in lockstep toward an image of DeSantis. Another, who also said they knew Hochman, added by associating with a Nazi sympathizer and putting out Nazi-adjacent propaganda, he was actually keeping young men away from fascism. ""His whole project has been to draw young right-wing men alienated by the stupidity of our politics *away* from the dark side. Cancelling him doesn't make that problem go away,"" wrote Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, which has been accused by the Southern Poverty Law Center of harboring racist writers and thinkers. Another conservative writer, Rod Dreher, said that he spoke to Hochman, who swore he wasn't a Nazi. Dreher, though, said he found it difficult to accept. ""Nate Hochman swears up and down to me that he had no idea that the Sonnenrad was a Nazi symbol. I told him I want to believe him, but it's very, very difficult to accept that someone of his generation who is as smart as he is really didn't know that very familiar Nazi image,"" Dreher tweeted.

As first the press secretary and now the director of rapid response for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis’ (R) flailing presidential campaign, Pushaw spends much of her time going after anyone who doesn’t exclusively praise her boss. There’s hardly a reporter in Florida who hasn’t been on the receiving end of one of her Twitter tirades. Twitter once suspended Pushaw for “abusive behavior” towards an Associated Press reporter who dared report that one of DeSantis’ top donors was also an investor in the company that makes Regeneron, the COVID-19 drug that the governor was then touting. Around the time DeSantis hired her in 2021, Pushaw wiped all her tweets. She also deleted her LinkedIn account, Facebook page, and website—though an archive of her website remains. An archive of her Twitter account from that March shows that there were close to 3,000 tweets in the deleted cache. She came in like a wrecking ball when she started afresh on Twitter (or are we calling it X now—and if so, why?) on May 6, 2021. In the roughly 800 days since then, she’s tweeted an astonishing 67,000 times for an average of 80 times a day. Along the way she developed a reputation for being caustic and relentless. It doesn’t help that there are legions of trolls who obediently attack anyone she targets. Pushaw doesn’t take as kindly to people attacking her, however. In a since-deleted tweet, she claimed to have sued Rebekah Jones, the data analyst who accused the DeSantis administration of falsifying the number of COVID deaths, for smearing her online. Dirtiest Delete Pushaw’s Twitter fingers do get burnt sometimes. She deleted a tweet urging people to “drag” a reporter. She also deleted one supposedly sarcastic tweet invoking antisemitic conspiracy theories about the Rothschild family. One dirty delete rises up like pond scum, however. In 2022, people stood on a Florida roadside waving Nazi flags, wearing swastikas, and shouting “white power” and calling Jewish people “the devil.” Pushaw responded by tweeting, “Do we even know they’re Nazis?” (Psst: We do.)

3459,DeSantis,2023-07-31,"""DeSantis drops below Vivek Ramaswamy in online election betting market PredictIt""","Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy may have a better shot at nabbing the Republican presidential nomination than Gov. Ron DeSantis (Fla.), betting site PredictIt indicates. Over the weekend, DeSantis dropped below Ramaswamy on the online gambling service for the first time since the two entered the crowded race, which includes former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence.  DeSantis has been in the public eye for years since he took over Florida in 2019 and developed a firebrand personality. Meanwhile, Ramaswamy was relatively unknown when he entered the race and is running an underdog campaign. PredictIt works by having users buy shares in a given candidate’s likelihood of reaching a certain outcome while running for office, somewhat similar to the stock market. For the 2024 presidential nomination, people can invest in any candidate they think will win or lose, even ones who haven’t declared, like Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) Users of PredictIt make bets on candidates by buying shares, the price of which is between one dollar and 99 cents per share. On Friday, Ramaswamy reached 19 cents in favor of a win, which was two cents above where DeSantis stood. Ramaswamy then dropped to 17 cents, just barely above DeSantis’ 16 cents, before returning to the current neck-and-neck price with DeSantis at 15 cents. In the past 90 days, bets on DeSantis have hovered in the high 20s and low 30s. Ramaswamy started at just three cents at the end of last month, but quickly ascended to 14 cents in mid-July, as DeSantis has faltered.  Bets have wanted on DeSantis as he continues to lag behind Trump in a new national poll and is stumping on economic policy in New Hampshire. DeSantis’ campaign has been plagued by controversy lately, and he recently shed a third of his staff. He also recently let go an aide who shared a video that included Nazi symbolism. New Zealand political tech company Aristotle launched Predictit in 2014, and it caught the internet’s attention during the 2016 election, providing insight that some say is better than what’s gleaned from polls, which are more a reflection of where voters stand on a candidate at that point in time, not guessing who might win. PredictIt calls on participants to put their money on how people will vote in the future, while also allowing Americans to participate in legal gambling on elections. But it hasn’t always been on the mark. Jeb Bush was pinned as a favorite by betters on the site months before he eventually dropped out after a poor showing in South Carolina. Shortly before the 2020 presidential race was called, PredictIt showed Biden’s chances of winning at 84 percent.  Meanwhile, Ramaswamy is on a victory lap, celebrating his emergence as a leading candidate. He recently reached the unique donor threshold required to appear at the first GOP debate in August and received a standing ovation when he stopped at the Lincoln Day Dinner in Iowa.

""Whenever I’m on a career advice panel for young conservatives, I tell them to avoid group chats that use the N-word or otherwise blur the line between edgelording and earnest bigotry,"" reporter Aaron Sibarium wrote on Monday. ""I’m often asked afterwards why I made a point of saying so. This is why,"" he added, along with a link to a scoop published by the Free Beacon detailing more antisemitic and problematic text messages sent by right-wing influencer Pedro Gonzalez. Gonzalez's years-old texts reported by the Free Beacon include the incorrect assertion that House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is Jewish (she's Catholic) and thus ""can't be criticized."" The Free Beacon's report followed an extensive takedown of Gonzalez by Breitbart in late June. The Daily Dot also recently reported on the leaked chats of far-right outlet the Liberty Conservative that included racial slurs. While Gonzalez—a vocal ally of Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R)—has slammed the reports as a ""smear campaign"" by Trump supporters, he has apologized for his past remarks and attributed his comments to a ""different, dumb season of my life."" ""What starts off as joking can very quickly become unironically internalized as an actual belief,"" he told the Free Beacon in an interview, adding that, ""I said those things, and I take responsibility for them, and I apologize for them, and, ultimately, it's on me."" He also said he is ""ashamed"" and ""embarrassed"" by his past comments. Reporting on Gonzalez's old messages divided some conservative circles, with some defending the influencer as being a target of cancel culture for ""old texts from when he was a dumb college student"" and others arguing that leaking private messages is a wrong move. Sibarium's response to the unfolding drama gets at the heart of the discussion about the ethics of leaking others' texts by putting the onus on the individual to avoid getting into a situation where problematic texts could be sent in the first place.

That means class schedules for the fall semester—which begins next week in most Florida school districts—are in limbo for thousands of students. Last year, around 28,000 pupils in more than 500 Florida high schools took AP Psychology. ""What a terrible decision that is 100% politically motivated."" In a statement, the College Board—the New York-based national body that approves AP courses and runs SAT testing—called sexual orientation and gender identity ""essential topics"" in psychology.""The AP course asks students to 'describe how sex and gender influence socialization and other aspects of development,'"" the board explained. ""This element of the framework is not new: gender and sexual orientation have been part of AP Psychology since the course launched 30 years ago.""""We cannot modify AP Psychology in response to regulations that would censor college-level standards for credit, placement, and career readiness,"" the body continued. ""Our policy remains unchanged. Any course that censors required course content cannot be labeled 'AP' or 'Advanced Placement,' and the 'AP Psychology' designation cannot be utilized on student transcripts."" — (@) ""To be clear, any AP Psychology course taught in Florida will violate either Florida law or college requirements,"" the College Board added. ""Therefore, we advise Florida districts not to offer AP Psychology until Florida reverses their decision and allows parents and students to choose to take the full course.""As originally signed into law by Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in March 2022, H.B. 1557—dubbed the ""Don't Say Gay or Trans"" bill by critics—""prohibits classroom discussion about sexual orientation or gender identity"" in grades K-3 or at any level ""that is not age-appropriate."" In May, DeSantis expanded the legislation to include all grades K-12.Randi Weingarten, president of the American Federation of Teachers, condemned the ""slippery slope of government censorship and bans"" in DeSantis' Florida. — (@) ""Sadly, it's all part of the DeSantis playbook of eroding rights, censoring those he disagrees with, and undermining access to knowledge,"" Weingarten said of the 2024 GOP presidential candidate, whose campaign has been accused of embracing homophobia. ""Just this year, countless educators have been forced to remove or cover up their classroom libraries under threat of sanctions and jail, countless students have lost out because the governor ended AP African American Studies, and now this assault on AP Psychology,"" she added. ""It's an unconscionable but far-from-surprising move from an extremist and increasingly unpopular leader who is fast becoming both a national pariah and a global embarrassment."" — (@) At the Human Rights Campaign, the nation's largest LGBTQ+ advocacy group, president Kelley Robinson said that ""psychology is centered around people—all people.""""Erasing us from the curriculum ignores our existence, sets back Florida students who want to pursue psychology in higher education, and disrupts pathways for future mental health professionals to provide comprehensive, culturally competent mental healthcare for the LGBTQ+ community,"" she continued. ""College Board's AP Psychology curriculum is science-driven and endorsed by both educators and experts,"" Robinson noted. ""Educational systems that reject the inclusion of LGBTQ+ people from their psychology courses are failing in their commitment to students.""""As anti-LGBTQ+ lawmakers pass discriminatory legislation and spread dangerous misinformation, we're continuing to see disturbing attempts to rewrite history and censor education, misaligned with the realities of our country,"" she added. Florida State Rep. Anna Eskamani (D-42) said in a statement, ""As someone who graduated from Florida public schools with college credit via AP classes, I know how powerful and effective these classes are and I am sick to my stomach to see what Gov.

They insist they have no tolerance for bigotry, and yet, they keep finding themselves with their pants down in a room full of racists.

Ellis was indicted along with former president Donald Trump and 17 other people in Fulton County, Georgia over their efforts to overturn the 2020 election. While Trump faces 13 criminal charges, Ellis faces two: violating the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations (RICO) Act and Solicitation of Violation of Oath by a Public Officer. ""The Democrats and the Fulton County DA are criminalizing the practice of law,"" Ellis said Tuesday. ""I am resolved to trust the Lord and I will simply continue to honor, praise, and serve Him."" But despite being named in the indictment, Ellis is reportedly not getting any assistance from Trump, especially not after Trump's base turned on her over her mild support for Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis (R). She publicly decried ""blatant sexism"" she experienced from Trump supporters and while she has praised both candidates, in July, she dubbed DeSantis—Trump's top primary opponent—as ""the best chance to save America."" On Tuesday, Ellis shared a fundraiser to help with her legal fees associated with the Georgia indictment, drawing mockery from some Trump supporters. ""If you didn't spend the last several months viciously attacking Trump supporters, they would have funded your entire legal fight,"" wrote one Trump supporter. ""Instead, it looks like you'll have to depend on the 14% of DeSantis supporters to help you out."" https://twitter.com/RealJohnSandor/status/1691651711960596717 Ellis responded with a story about not everything being about politics and said she's ""not going to stop speaking or start changing my political opinions just to endear myself to you or anyone else."" ""I’m a private citizen being unjustly targeted by the government because I represented Donald Trump. You can support me in this or not,"" she added. But the one poster is far from the only Trump supporter taking jabs at Ellis. Pro-Trump influencer Alex Bruesewitz, who Ellis previously accused of harassment, used another insult on Tuesday, writing, ""Why would Trump want to support someone as disgraceful as Jebba?"" https://twitter.com/alexbruesewitz/status/1691500725719756800 ""You don't deserve one cent for the way you trashed Trump!"" wrote another user. https://twitter.com/SadieInNC/status/1691653421638496556 ""Do not fall for her lies,"" wrote far-right internet personality Laura Loomer. ""Jenna Ellis hates Donald Trump and his supporters and she has already threatened to flip on him. Do NOT donate."" Another person posted: ""Jenna Ellis turned on Trump to support DeSantis so NO supporting her. She reaped the whirlwind and karma is a b*tch."" But despite the push back from some Trump supporters, Ellis' fundraising campaign has received donations from more than 200 people totaling over $13,000 as of Wednesday afternoon.

Ramaswamy responded to the report Thursday afternoon, who called it ""another boring, establishment attack from Super PAC-creation 'Robot Ron' who is literally taking lame, pre-programmed attack lines against me for next week’s debate."" https://twitter.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1692202661410750526 The strategy documents indicate that DeSantis' campaign may view Ramaswamy as his biggest threat at the Aug. 23 debate, given that former President Donald Trump is not expected to participate. Ramaswamy, a political newcomer, has recently been closing the gap between him and DeSantis. A RealClearPolitics polling average between July 23-Aug. 15 shows Ramaswamy in third place with 6.7%, about eight points behind DeSantis. That's a 4.3-point increase for Ramaswamy in the last two months, compared to a 5.4-point decrease for DeSantis. And Ramaswamy is polling ahead of former Vice President Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Chris Christie—all of whom had bigger name recognition coming into the race than Ramaswamy. While the debate memo also encouraged DeSantis to defend Trump in absentia from attacks wielded by Christie, Trump has celebrated DeSantis' drop in polls, referencing a recent survey by RMG Research. The polling firm holds a B- rating from FiveThirtyEight. ""It’s over for Ron DeSanctimonious, now in 3rd place. Ramaswamy now in 2nd,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday. ""RMG Research.

Ron DeSantis (R-Fla.), who continues plummeting in 2024 presidential primary polls. Some people on Twitter are noticing that he might not be handling the pressure so well. In a video posted by Fox News' Paul Steinhauser, DeSantis seems to barely be able to contain the tension when he’s asked about a recently leaked memo posted online by a company with close links to Never Back Down, a super PAC close to the DeSantis’ campaign.  According to the New York Times, which first reported the memo, Never Back Down “has effectively taken over … [DeSantis’] presidential campaign.” The memo, posted on the website of a close advisor to the super PAC, lays out a strategy for the governor to follow to stand out on the stage, including attacking the surging Vivek Ramaswamy as a “fake” and defending former president Donald Trump, who won’t be on the stage, from an attack by Chris Christie. https://twitter.com/steinhauserNH1/status/1692973204510306561 Steinhauser asked DeSantis first about the idea that the “knives will be out” for him at the Republican primary debate on Wednesday.  DeSantis gave the reporter a pained smile in response. Then, when Steinhauser asked a question about the memo, DeSantis can clearly be seen grinding his teeth as the question is asked. “Hes got Homelander tics now,” commented Twitter user @lib_crusher in a retweet. https://twitter.com/lib_crusher/status/1693347306735632733 Homelander, played by Antony Starr in the Amazon Prime series The Boys, often responds to tension and anxiety by subtly grinding his teeth and blowing air out of his mouth while hearing a ringing sound. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lh-F6QzJdrE “Starr clenches his teeth and or blows air into his lower lip and cheek area when homelander is trying to suppress anger or remain calm,” explained u/TlN4C in an r/TheBoys thread discussing the show. “I cannot unsee him as homelander now, thanks,” wrote @Twitter user Joexor. “I will never unsee it now” wrote Twitter user @D_Bowey. “This is creepy how accurate it is” Twitter user @Spoopy0_0 wrote.

4483,DeSantis,2023-08-21,"""In Maui, Advocates Demand Climate Accountability From Biden During Visit""","Today, as President Biden visits Maui to survey the damage from catastrophic wildfires, climate advocates and community leaders are demanding bold action from Biden, including a national climate emergency declaration, which would unlock executive powers to aggressively combat the crisis. The Maui fires, which claimed the lives of more than a hundred residents, destroyed hundreds of homes and displaced thousands of residents, are the latest in a string of extreme weather disasters fueled by climate change that have impacted communities across the country this summer. Advocates are urging Biden to halt new fossil fuel leasing and exports, ramp up clean energy manufacturing, and direct funding to build climate resilience in vulnerable communities.""I am glad that President Biden is visiting Maui today, and that he has committed to delivering everything we need to recover from these catastrophic wildfires, including FEMA funding and support – but there’s a lot more he needs to do,” said Kaniela Ing, National Director of the Green New Deal Network and a seventh-generation Kānaka Maoli from Maui. “I hope President Biden will offer small businesses and workers direct relief, like he did during the COVID-19 pandemic, so we can pause tourism while maintaining a strong economy. I hope President Biden will protect displaced residents from the disaster capitalists seeking to profit off their grief by instituting a moratorium on foreclosures and subsidizing mortgage and rent payments for at least a year. I hope President Biden will support Maui’s lawsuit against oil companies to pay for the damages they caused. And I hope President Biden will declare a climate emergency to end all new fossil fuel development so that tragedies like this don’t become a regular occurrence. I look forward to seeing President Biden meet these needs and support us in building a future centered around justice for our ʻāina hānau and the Kamaʻāina who hold it dear.”Declaring an emergency would align with the 74% of Democrats and 52% of all Americans who believe we are facing a climate emergency, according to 2021 polling. It would also send a strong signal that the administration is taking decisive action in the face of worsening extreme weather.These deadly fires also renew focus on Maui's ongoing legal battle to hold fossil fuel companies accountable. In 2020, the county sued Exxon, Chevron, BP, Shell and others for knowingly causing climate change damages, including increased wildfire risk.The complaint details Big Oil's responsibility for ""increased frequency, intensity, and destructive force of wildfires"" on Maui due to hotter, drier conditions. It also outlines sea level rise, flooding, extreme heat, and other climate impacts.Maui is still fighting to get its case to trial after years of fossil fuel company efforts to delay and dismiss the lawsuit, and leading advocates in the fight to hold Big Oil accountable are calling for Biden to use the trip to support this lawsuit. “It's time for President Biden to make clear to the American people that the oil and gas industry must be held accountable for their lies and pollution that continue to fuel the climate crisis,” said Richard Wiles, president of the Center for Climate Integrity, an organization that supports climate liability lawsuits.",Common Dreams,Business,No,15.220128830871618,52.410254548607085,90.94374060938152,6.528176867283264,47.098725897176514,53.15415700690486,maui advocates,{},"{'wildfires': 'catastrophic', 'action': 'decisive', 'climate': 'national', 'powers': 'executive', 'disasters': 'extreme', 'leasing': 'new', 'manufacturing': 'clean', 'funding': 'direct', 'communities': 'vulnerable', 'generation': 'seventh', 'businesses': 'small', 'relief': 'direct', 'economy': 'strong', 'residents': 'displaced', 'development': 'new', 'occurrence': 'regular', 'signal': 'strong', 'weather': 'extreme', 'fires': 'deadly', 'battle': 'legal', 'damages': 'causing', 'risk': 'increased', 'frequency': 'increased', 'force': 'destructive', 'conditions': 'drier', 'heat': 'extreme', 'impacts': 'other', 'advocates': 'leading', 'people': 'american'}",1,0

4494,DeSantis,2023-08-21,"""EPA Pulls Plug on Smog Standards Reevaluation, Provoking Outcry""","The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced today that it is pulling the plug on its reconsideration of the National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for ground-level ozone, commonly referred to as smog and starting a lengthy, slow full review. As a result of today’s decision, if the EPA doesn’t pick up the pace, the agency would likely complete its review in the late 2020s, denying communities any chance of stronger ozone standards until implementation began sometime in the early 2030s. The EPA’s decision comes despite mounting evidence of the adverse health impacts and environmental damage caused by ozone pollution. Environmental advocacy groups condemn the decision as scientifically, legally and morally insupportable. Just two short years ago, the EPA won praise for its announcement that it would start and, by end of 2023, finish a reconsideration of a December 2020 decision to retain outdated standards. As part of that process, this past June, 18 independent experts on the Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee (CASAC) reviewed the existing ozone NAAQS, and all, except one, concluded that “the scientific evidence unequivocally demonstrates that the current primary and secondary standards are not protective of public health and public welfare.” With the powerful existing evidence that the current standards allow ozone levels that send people to the hospital and harm sensitive ecosystems, the Clean Air Act demands the EPA strengthen protections. The White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council recently called on the EPA to finalize strong new ozone standards by spring 2024. The EPA’s decision rejects that recommendation. And the EPA’s ozone NAAQS reviews routinely lag, meaning that, unless the EPA devotes to this issue the attention it deserves, overburdened communities will likely have to wait until, at earliest, the late 2020s before they could get the needed, overdue protections. In the meantime, children, people with asthma, and older adults who are most sensitive to smog will continue to suffer serious health harms. “The consequences of inaction on ozone are clear—more asthma attacks, increased respiratory illnesses, and harm to vulnerable communities,” said Raul Garcia, Earthjustice Vice President of Policy and Legislation. “Despite its commitments and the clear recommendations by WHEJAC and by EPA’s own Clean Air Scientific Advisory Committee, the Biden administration has failed to follow the science and prioritize the health and well-being of our communities. And, since 2008, the EPA has scorned the clear science and the law and refused to set a separate standard to protect the environment. It is shameful that the EPA has now locked that unprotective, unjustifiable approach indefinitely. People at home will continue to ask themselves: how many deaths or asthma attacks does it take to merit action on ozone? The science tells us we are long overdue. The EPA must come through for communities with strong NAAQS, not this waffling and punting.” Ground-level ozone continues to pose serious health risks, particularly to vulnerable populations, and failing to address this issue hampers progress toward cleaner air nationwide, for everyone. Ozone pollution, a byproduct of fossil fuel emissions from vehicles, factories, and other sources, causes severe health harms, like asthma attacks and other respiratory issues, and has been linked to premature deaths. Ozone pollution also damages the environment. It slows plant growth, including for certain tree species and agricultural crops. Through its effects on vegetation, it can alter and harm entire ecosystems. It is also itself a powerful greenhouse gas. Community members and health and scientific experts have been advocating for decades for more stringent ozone standards to ensure cleaner air and healthier living conditions. The current ozone NAAQS were set in 2015. They were hastily reviewed and retained in a December 2020 decision that sparked significant criticism. Because it abandoned its reconsideration process, the EPA is now legally obligated to complete a full review of the ozone standards by December 23, 2025. This is not the first time an EPA reconsideration of weak ozone standards has abruptly ended. In 2011, the White House directed the EPA to drop its reconsideration of the 2008 ozone standards, a decision that undermined public health and the environment. Even more delay ensued, stopping only when health and environmental groups sued the EPA to compel it to finish its overdue work. And even with the extra time, in 2015, the EPA once again set an environmental standard that failed to stand up in court. The EPA is further along in its reconsideration of the particulate matter NAAQS, with a final decision expected this fall. Communities, health, and environmental groups will be watching.",Common Dreams,Business,No,15.220128830871618,77.2919948837835,99.9972807607382,6.528176867283264,47.098725897176514,53.15415700690486,epa plug,{},"{'review': 'full', 'standards': 'weak', 'evidence': 'existing', 'impacts': 'adverse', 'damage': 'environmental', 'groups': 'environmental', 'years': 'short', 'experts': 'independent', 'ozone': 'current', 'health': 'public', 'welfare': 'public', 'ecosystems': 'entire', 'communities': 'vulnerable', '2020s': 'late', 'protections': 'overdue', 'adults': 'older', 'harms': 'severe', 'attacks': 'more', 'illnesses': 'respiratory', 'recommendations': 'clear', 'science': 'clear', 'standard': 'environmental', 'approach': 'unjustifiable', 'deaths': 'premature', 'risks': 'serious', 'populations': 'vulnerable', 'air': 'cleaner', 'sources': 'other', 'issues': 'respiratory', 'species': 'certain', 'crops': 'agricultural', 'gas': 'powerful', 'conditions': 'living', 'criticism': 'significant', 'time': 'extra', 'delay': 'more', 'work': 'overdue', 'decision': 'final'}",1,0

It’s a weird scenario because the former would normally preclude the latter.Let’s start with the notion that he can’t beat Joe Biden. Anyone who watched Trump defy the experts in 2016 should be skeptical of such declarations. But according to a recent poll from The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, “53% of Americans say they would definitely not support [Trump] if he is the nominee.”This leaves Trump with 47% of the electorate that is “gettable,” which is an important caveat when you consider that he picked the Electoral College lock by winning just 46% of the popular vote in 2016. However, in addition to the 53% who definitely won’t vote for Trump in 2024, “Another 11% say they would probably not support him in November 2024”—which is to say that 64% of voters are unlikely to support Trump.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,No,14.471224155577003,84.38174732095419,99.94169140021498,3.1676386048321,53.0945708300492,52.01972209858979,trump voters,{},"{'polls': 'recent', 'primary': 'republican', 'scenario': 'weird', 'declarations': 'such', 'poll': 'recent', 'caveat': 'important', 'vote': 'popular'}",0,1

Super PAC told him to call biotech entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy “Vivek the Fake” or “Fake Vivek” in the upcoming Republican presidential primary debate, but neither of those ones really seemed to fit. Now, Twitter users have landed on VivekGPT, a nod to how the popular AI ChatGPT tool performs, giving you any answer you want as long as you ask him the question the right way. ChatGPT is a large language model that users can “chat” with and receive what seems like natural answers. But ChatGPT has also been criticized for not returning consistent responses and tailoring its output to the way a question is asked. Now, it's being used on the breakout Republican candidate. “‘VivekGPT’ is as close to perfection as nicknames get. Kudos to whomever came up with it,” wrote Twitter user @PowerOwn45. “VivekGPT doesn’t care about beliefs or if the claim makes sense,” wrote @AGHamilton29. “He just automatically calculates how he can frame the convo to appeal to a specific subgroup of voters,” calling him a “ChatGPT"" candidate. His position on COVID-19, in particular, has been called out as GPT-esque. Ramaswamy has been critical of the U.S. government’s COVID pandemic response during his campaign and he criticized the idea that the disease has a natural origin. But the biotech entrepreneur’s company Datavant also pitched a data repository for COVID patients, which some conservatives have dubbed a “COVID passport.” “LMAO VivekGPT tried to sell a Covid passport system to the government,” pointed out @redneckskeptic. “He’s hardly pro-medical choice. Unless you believe his words vs his actions.” Ramaswamy has also been criticized for blatantly inconsistent positions, like when he denied suggesting pardoning members of Biden’s family, which he did suggest doing, or his recent hullabaloo over 9/11, where he claimed then denied he claimed the attack was an inside job. Today, Twitter users also highlighted how that same sort of flip-flopping inconsistency reared its head when it came to whether Trump should appear at the Republican presidential debate tomorrow. “It would be fundamentally uncourageous for Donald Trump to choose not to debate,” Ramaswamy is shown saying in a video posted by Twitter user @AGHamilton29. The video then cuts to Ramaswamy being asked if he thinks Trump should attend the first Republican debate. “I don’t have a strong opinion on it,” he answers, before a hard cut to Ramaswamy standing in front of his campaign bus. “Trump will be there because as I’ve known him, he’s not a man to be afraid,” Ramaswamy says. https://twitter.com/AGHamilton29/status/1694075008308351461 “This is bizarre to watch,” commented a Republican communications strategist, Matt Whitlock. “[H]ow does he take fifteen different positions on whether or not Trump should debate in just like 2 months? VivekGPT is spot on.” https://twitter.com/mattdizwhitlock/status/1694077213660811619 The name was almost perfect for Twitter user @DastDn, who had only one problem with it. “Super torn. On the one hand, the temptation to refer to Ramaswamy as VivekGPT from now own is nigh unbearable. On the other - that a whole 3 extra letters.” Twitter user @FilmLadd summed it up succintly: “VivekGPT and ChatGPT both suffer from the problems of making s--t up and not knowing what's real and what isn't.” Sign up to receive the Daily Dot’s Internet Insider newsletter for urgent news from the frontline of online.

4741,DeSantis,2023-08-24,"""‘U know what u mean by that’: Jason Aldean’s ‘Try That In a Small Town’ shows controversy can create a viral TikTok sound""","“Try that in a small town,” goads country music megastar Jason Aldean in his most recent hit song of the same name.  The track released in May 2023 and mostly flew under the radar but exploded into the zeitgeist when it’s music video counterpart dropped on YouTube several weeks later. Many accused the artist of glamorizing racially insensitive imagery, but that hasn’t it stopped it from being used in 250,000 TikTok videos and stacking 26 million views on YouTube. TikToker @thejohnnyman has the top video with nearly 4 million views, where he comically juxtaposes country vs. hip-hop lyrics. In the original song, Aldean names activities of which he finds to be despicable, many of them criminal, while showing real footage of said acts, “Sucker punch somebody on a sidewalk. Carjack an old lady at a red light. Pull a gun on the owner of a liquor store. Ya think it's cool, well, act a fool if ya like. Cuss out a cop, spit in his face. Stomp on the flag and light it up,” then begs the perpetrators of these acts to, “Try that in a small town.” @thejohnnymann A lot of people are callin themselves out with this one 😭 #fyp #jasonaldean #smalltown #racism #debate #politics #blacktiktok #blm #viral #trending #usa #xyzbca #trythatinasmalltown ♬ Try That In A Small Town - Jason Aldean Many headlines touting rising crime statistics across the country have dominated news cycles in the past several years, most citing the psychological and economically damaging effects of the pandemic as catalysts. Aldean thinks this is no excuse and promises repercussions of such acts, “See how far ya make it down the road. Around here, we take care of our own. You cross that line, it won't take long. For you to find out, I recommend you don't…” Many have argued that the song’s lyrics don’t mention race once, including Aldean himself, however, they have cited that the backdrop of the music video portrays Aldean and his band performing in front of the Maury County Courthouse in Columbia, Tennessee, a site where a Black teenager was lynched in 1927. “Try That In a Small Town” aside, Aldean and his wife Brittany have been controversial figures in the music, pop culture, and political scene for years now. Aldean's PR agency, GreenRoom, dropped him in 2022 shortly after his wife made an Instagram post where she remarked that she was happy her parents didn't change her gender when she was going through her tomboy phase. Was his most recent song just the straw that broke the camels back? The uproar from the “Try That In a Small Town” video has ignited a diverse range of reactions. While Country Music Television pulled the video from its lineup amidst accusations of promoting violence and racism, Aldean's conservative supporters, including former President Donald Trump and Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, rallied to his defense, asserting his right to free speech. The incident also rekindles past controversies, shedding light on Aldean's political statements and his wife Brittany's outspoken views. Amidst the fervor, Aldean's track has surged up the Billboard Hot 100 charts, reigniting discussions about the role of artists and their influence on society. As the dust settles, the ""Try That In a Small Town"" saga underscores the complexities of artistic expression, political alignment, and societal sensitivities, prompting introspection about the intertwined nature of music and culture. You may have only heard of Aldean because of this recent controversy, but he’s been in the news for well over 10 years now. Here are some of the highlights: 1) September 2012: Cheating Scandal - Aldean was caught kissing American Idol contestant Brittany Kerr while married to Jessica Ussery, leading to divorce. 2) September 2015: Remarks on Female Singers - Aldean's comments about female country singers' similar voices sparked criticism for lack of diversity in the genre. When asked by the Washington Post about the emergence of more female voices in country, Aldean remarked, “I feel like a lot of times female singers, to me, when they’re singing and I’ll probably kick myself for saying this a lot of times, it just seems like I can’t distinguish one from the other sometimes if I just listen to them, you know?“ Aldean said. “A lot of times they just sound really similar to me.” 3)  October 2015: Blackface Incident - Aldean faced backlash for dressing as rapper Lil Wayne in blackface at a Halloween party. October 2017:  Mass-Shooting Incident - Aldean was performing his song ""When She Says Baby"" at the Las Vegas Route 91 Harvest Festival when shots were fired into the crowd by Stephen Paddock, resulting in at least 58 deaths and more than 500 injuries. Fortunately, Aldean and his crew were not injured. After an initial post expressing his sadness, thoughts, and prayers for the victims, Aldean now penned a longer letter that touches on his fear at the current state of the world, the need for people to come together, and his continued thoughts and prayers for the victims of the largest mass shooting in U.S. history. 5)  October 2021: Vaccine Mandate Protests - Aldean criticized school vaccine mandates particularly in California, leading to debates about parental rights and freedom. 6) August 2022: Controversial Transgender comments - Aldean's wife, Brittany Kerr, made anti-trans comments on social media, drawing backlash and accusations of insensitivity. Brittany posted to Instagram with the message, “I’d really like to thank my parents for not changing my gender when I went through my tomboy phase. I love this girly life.” 7)  September 2022: PR Company Split - Aldean's longtime Nashville publicity firm ended its association with him after his wife's further doubling down about her issues with “gender affirming care” writing in an Instagram post, “Advocating for the genital mutilation of children under the disguise of love and calling it ‘gender affirming care’ is one of the worst evils.” 8)  July 2023: ""Try That in a Small Town"" Music Video Controversy - Accusations of racism in the music video led to public outcry, with CMT pulling the clip from rotation. This is the latest publicized controversy in a series of conservative v. liberal cultural battles that have dominated headlines and social media feeds. Most recently the fallout of Bud Light after putting trans-activist Dylan Mulvaney on a special edition beer can comes to mind. Also, Jim Caviezel, most known as portraying Jesus in the Mel Gibson’s film “The Passion of the Christ”, starred in a movie called The Sound of Freedom about real-life Department of Homeland Security operative Tim Ballard taking down a child sex-trafficking ring. Many accused the film’s star Caviezel of parroting Qanon and far-right talking points. It should be noted that Jason Aldean is not credited as a writer of “Try That In a Small Town.” Instead the credits go to Kelley Lovelace, Kurt Allison, Neil Thrasher, and Tully Kennedy but Aldean has happily become the face and voice of its message. Nevertheless, Jason Aldean's current dominance of the Hot 100 charts signals a remarkable milestone in his career, marking his first leadership on America's most significant song chart. However, this achievement is enveloped in controversy, heralding a potential era of chart-topping hits that polarize the nation. Many have accused Cardi B’s “WAP” to be its left-leaning political opposite. Our own Catherine Caruso covered the comparison here. “Small Town’s” trajectory from obscurity to chart supremacy gained momentum upon the release of its contentious music video weeks after its Spotify and iTunes drop, igniting both fervent support and vehement criticism. Amid accusations of racial insensitivity, the song's success paradoxically owes itself to the very controversy it generated, drawing attention from those who opposed its message. Jason Aldean's bold embrace of provocative content has yielded tangible results, propelling his single to meteoric heights on the charts. This accomplishment may serve as a blueprint for future artists seeking notoriety through controversy, potentially paving the way for a trend where outrage becomes a strategy for achieving chart-topping status. This phenomenon mirrors the broader political landscape, where extreme viewpoints gain traction and divide society further. As the allure of leveraging controversy to achieve musical success grows, listeners confront a moral quandary of whether to engage with songs that thrive on controversy or to disengage as an act of protest. Aldean’s track proves the former is probably more likely. The power of controversy in elevating otherwise potentially forgettable or cliche songs to chart-topping glory raises both the potential for musical triumph but also the ethical complexities of perpetuating societal divisions through art.

Trump prompted intense coverage and detailed discussions in the Kremlin-controlled state media. Russian propagandists and analysts speculate that the criminal prosecutions won’t hurt their favorite candidate, but only bolster his popularity. Encouraged by their belief that most of the GOP’s top contenders would limit or stop U.S. aid to Ukraine, Russian talking heads nonetheless prefer Trump himself.Referring to Trump’s booking record in Georgia, reporter Valentin Bogdanov, who is based in New York City, told the audience of 60 Minutes, “Our strawberry blonde! There is only one like him in the United States.” In his report for the evening edition of Vesti on channel Rossiya-1, Bogdanov showcased Trump’s mugshot along with that of Frank Sinatra, Michael Jackson, and Elvis Presley. He mused that in his legal struggle, Trump likely sees his rightful place alongside Martin Luther King Jr. and Nelson Mandela, like someone “who suffered for the sake of truth.”During his Saturday show on channel Solovyov Live, Yevgeny Satanovsky continued the same train of thought, lionizing Trump alongside some of the most prominent historic figures: “He is like Nelson Mandela, like Martin Luther King Jr., he is being persecuted by an evil shadow government!” Satanovsky feverishly claimed that Trump might be assassinated, like Abraham Lincoln or John F. Kennedy.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,No,14.756055756235012,74.37246519261579,91.81519716035092,4.445755198228848,34.48183987007241,58.24101484436766,trump russia,{},"{'indictments': 'multiple', 'coverage': 'intense', 'discussions': 'detailed', 'media': 'controlled', 'propagandists': 'russian', 'prosecutions': 'criminal', 'candidate': 'favorite', 'contenders': 'top', 'heads': 'russian', 'struggle': 'legal', 'place': 'rightful', 'train': 'same', 'figures': 'historic', 'shadow': 'evil'}",1,0
