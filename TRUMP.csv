1,Trump,2023-03-16,"""‘Swarm’: How Beyoncé’s Fan Army Inspired the Wildest Show of the Year""","Courtesy of Prime VideoNo group on Al Gore’s internet is more mystifying than pop-music stans. Whether they’re using their collective powers for good (like when K-Pop stans sank a Donald Trump rally in 2020) or pure evil (like when Swifties harassed the young star of a Netflix show over a scripted joke), their presence on social media and in the larger music landscape has become inescapable, overwhelming, and a bit terrifying, to say the least. Still, there hasn’t been much representation of what these people’s lives look like away from their computer screens.Swarm, on Prime Video this Friday, is maybe (hopefully) more of the Tarantino-esque nightmare we imagine to be a pop stan’s day-to-day life than what normally occurs in reality. Co-created by Janine Nabers and Donald Glover, the series follows a young Black woman named Dre (Dominique Fishback), whose obsession with a Beyoncé-esque superstar named Ni’Jah takes her down a shocking and disturbing path. The less details viewers know going into the series the better, as it features a number of disorienting and weirdly delightful surprises. That said, it will certainly leave fans of the psychosexual thriller genre feeling fed.It’s not surprising that the pitch for a TV show so twisted but also grounded in truth came from Glover’s brain. Arguably since his 2010 mixtape Culdesac, Glover’s larger-than-life rap persona Childish Gambino has spurred an online cult of its own. The multihyphenate brought the idea for Swarm to Nabers, who executive produced and wrote on the last two seasons of his FX series Atlanta. And it hardly seems like much of a coincidence that the show is heavily inspired by Beyoncé’s ardent fanbase called the BeyHive, given that Nabers is from Houston.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,Yes,44.931688075213735,10.14083576648733,97.36229524346324,8.623452961501089,0.0,86.65545972346959,swarm beyoncé,{},"{'music': 'larger', 'powers': 'collective', 'evil': 'pure', 'star': 'young', 'joke': 'scripted', 'media': 'social', 'representation': 'much', 'nightmare': 'esque', 'woman': 'black', 'superstar': 'esque', 'path': 'shocking', 'details': 'less', 'surprises': 'disorienting', 'genre': 'psychosexual', 'pitch': 'twisted', 'persona': 'larger', 'cult': 'online', 'seasons': 'last', 'fanbase': 'ardent'}",0,0

6,Trump,2023-03-16,"""Don't Look Now, But the Far Right May Be Trying to Steal the Future""","If you're a well-informed Republican leader, you know you have a problem. The extreme right-wing, which is really the only right-wing that exists these days, is losing the future. Baby boomers may still love them, but millennials and Generation Zers largely reject their agenda. Year by year, as more boomers disappear, Gen Zers, the age group Republicans do by far the worst with, are not only coming of age, but also voting in greater numbers than many expected. Meanwhile, while the data is somewhat mixed, recent evidence suggests millennials may actually be growing even less conservative as they age. So, what's a political party facing this reality supposed to do? They could try making themselves more attractive to young voters. But for that to be successful they would have to be willing to alter their positions on the social and cultural issues that have made them a pariah to the young. And that is something their base, voters they can't afford to lose, will never allow. Talk of a more moderate GOP is a pipe dream. The hate-based politics the party embraced in supporting Donald Trump (and embraced well before that in their racist southern strategy) has become a trap. The GOP is now inexorably affixed to a policy agenda that is anathema to young voters. Think about how you would proceed if you had almost limitless resources and wanted to change the political vision of future voters. But before we are foolhardy enough to count the GOP out, we need to remember the secret sauce that fuels its successes—the money: billions of dollars tossed their way, spare change from America's increasingly wealthy plutocratic class. By far the most important thing this lucre has provided right-wing politics is a series of decades-long crusades designed to fundamentally change the nation's courts and educational system, destroy unions, end, or drastically curtail, government programs such as Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, and drastically reduce the share of the tax burden assessed to the wealthy. Taken together, these interlocking crusades have already changed America in profound and troubling ways. All of these projects share one important characteristic—a commitment to playing the long game. This isn't about winning one election, though there is money enough to fight those battles as well. No, this is nothing less than a decades-long effort by American plutocrats to change this nation in fundamental ways. Probably the best known of these long-term-conservative projects has been the effort to remake the nation's judiciary, spearheaded by The Federalist Society. The extent of the far-right's victory in this decades-old project was demonstrated, in devastating fashion, when the Court announced the Dobbs decision, overruling Roe v. Wade. We are discussing here, however, a different crusade—but one with the potential to be every bit as impactful. As we have seen, the right is losing the future politically. They are also extremely unlikely to modify their positions enough to win over young voters. They are not, however, without remedy. They may not be able to win the future, but that doesn't mean they won't try to steal it. Audacious political thievery is, after all, one of the GOP's modern-calling cards. Year after year, they've been stealing elections through vote suppression and extreme gerrymandering. In 2020, they came within a whisker of successfully stealing the presidency through a multi-headed conspiracy of fake electors, efforts to suppress the vote count, false accusations of election fraud, a violent insurrection and, most remarkably, through the act of 147 Republican members of Congress in voting to overturn the will of the American people in a presidential election. But how do you steal the future? If you're playing the long game, and you don't like the voters the future is likely to produce, you can try growing different ones. What follows includes speculation. But it's informed speculation that makes sense based upon established fact. Think about how you would proceed if you had almost limitless resources and wanted to change the political vision of future voters. You would want to gain control of the institutions that will influence their worldview. And if we set aside parents and friends, the biggest such influence is their schools. And, sure enough, a right-wing effort to seize control of education in America is underway. Step one is the destruction of the public school system. Destroying public education advances a number of right-wing goals, including damaging public unions and decreasing the role of government. Ginning up fake controversies about CRT and teaching children about slavery, in addition to becoming GOP talking points, play into the picture they are trying to paint of public schools as scary places where liberals are trying to brainwash their children. But it will also redirect students to private academies, many of which are operated by conservative-religious organizations and for-profit corporations, most of which will be happy to push conservative views. And these institutions can be expected to explode in size and number as more public money becomes available to private schools. When viewed from this perspective, actions of the political right that were previously bewildering start to make sense. The list is long—advocating public funding of private schools while starving the public school system, supporting private charter schools, book banning in schools, shoveling massive amounts of cash to right wing-candidates in local school board races, overstating deficiencies in public education, disruption of school board meetings, politically motivated criticism of individual public school teachers, a fake dispute over Critical Race Theory, increased corporatization of public schools and universities, and complaints over teaching history on topics “likely to disturb children,” such as slavery. If we lose this battle and comprehensive public education is allowed to wither and die, America is unlikely to ever see it here again. The pattern is inescapable. Public funding of private schools, including charter schools, doesn't just pump money into right-wing-educational academies. It also takes funding away from public schools, thereby degrading their quality. Ginning up fake controversies about CRT and teaching children about slavery, in addition to becoming GOP talking points, play into the picture they are trying to paint of public schools as scary places where liberals are trying to brainwash their children. Similarly, the constant disparagement of the quality of public education works to reduce its public support, while the growing trend of corporatizing public schools bolsters the goal of limiting teaching to vocational skills, while undercutting the traditional role of the public school in providing future governing generations with the knowledge they need to grow into informed citizens of a democracy. Right-wing billionaires dump big money into school board races in order to elect people that favor privatizing public schools, and on and on. Public education is under attack, and we have a good idea why. If we lose this battle and comprehensive public education is allowed to wither and die, America is unlikely to ever see it here again.

She actually took the rare step of handing over the lawyer’s notes to federal prosecutors, according to a person familiar with the arrangement.In doing so, Howell may have planted the seeds for a future constitutional challenge. But in the immediate term, she’s handed Justice Department Special Prosecutor Jack Smith a parting gift: what she deemed evidence of a crime involving the former president improperly hoarding classified documents after he left office.M.

Steve Daines of Montana garnered applause from a room full of bankers on Tuesday after he dismissed calls for tougher regulations following the collapse of Silicon Valley Bank and Signature Bank.""There are a lot of talking heads out there who are saying that the solution is more regulation, and I strongly disagree,"" Daines said in remarks to the American Bankers Association's Washington Summit, an annual gathering of bank CEOs and other top executives.The Montana Republican went on to defend a 2018 law that progressive lawmakers and experts have said is at least partly responsible for the recent bank failures. That measure, known as S.2155, weakened post-financial crisis regulations for banks with between $50 billion and $250 billion in assets, subjecting firms such as SVB—which lobbied for the changes—to less stringent oversight and paving the way for more risk-taking and industry consolidation.Daines, a member of the Senate Banking Committee and a major recipient of securities industry donations, called the stricter liquidity requirements and other rules gutted by the 2018 law ""overreaching regulations"" and claimed that efforts to revive the safeguards are creating ""more worry"" in the banking sector.""This was not the cause of this failure,"" Daines said of S.2155, which former President Donald Trump signed into law after it passed with bipartisan support. Watch the senator's remarks, which begin at the 1:32:04 mark: None — (@) It's unsurprising that Daines' defense of S.2155 was received favorably by a gathering of the American Bankers Association, which was one of many industry groups that lobbied aggressively for the measure.""The lobbyists were everywhere.

Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Bryan Steil (R-Wis.), and James Comer (R-Tenn.)—respectively the chairs of the House Judiciary, Administration, and Oversight Committees—the Manhattan DA's general counsel Leslie Dubeck wrote that the lawmakers' request earlier this week for confidential information pertaining to the Trump probe amounted to ""an unprecedented inquiry into a pending local prosecution.""Dubeck wrote that the GOP lawmakers' Monday letter demanding that Bragg turn over communications and other documents related to the investigation ""only came after Donald Trump created a false expectation that he would be arrested the next day and his lawyers reportedly urged you to intervene.""""Neither fact is a legitimate basis for congressional inquiry,"" Dubeck continued. ""The district attorney is obliged by the federal and state constitutions to protect the independence of state law enforcement functions from federal interference.""The reply from Bragg's office came just before news broke that the Manhattan grand jury tasked with considering possible criminal charges against the former president is not expected to convene again until at least Monday of next week.Trump set off a firestorm over the weekend by claiming on his social media platform that he would be arrested on Tuesday and urging his supporters to mobilize in response.

He was reimbursed in 2017 by the Trump Organization.The former president has made several public statements about the case against him in recent days, saying last weekend that he expected to be indicted on Tuesday and calling for a ""protest"" in New York, and posting an image in social media on Thursday showing Trump holding a baseball bat next to Bragg's head.His call for ""death and destruction"" is his most explicit statement about potential violence, said critics including government watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW).

His performance over the last couple of weeks has not instilled confidence. We’ve watched him flip-flop on everything from cutting entitlement programs, to his support of Ukraine. We have also seen Trump belittle him with nicknames like “Ron DeSanctimonious” and “Meatball Ron,” not to mention implying that he’s a “groomer.” (DeSantis also just denied an anecdote in a Daily Beast report that he once ate pudding with three fingers on a private flight. Gross.)This erratic behavior seems to have left a mark. As The New York Times’ Nate Cohn wrote last week, “In surveys taken since the Trump offensive began two months ago, Mr. DeSantis, the Florida governor, has steadily lost ground against Mr. Trump, whose own numbers have increased.” And that was before DeSantis tried to have it both ways regarding the potential arrest of Donald Trump. (He criticized the prosecutor, while adding, “I don’t know what goes into paying hush money to a porn star to secure silence over some type of alleged affair.”)But I’m more moved by what is admittedly anecdotal: the vibes.

229,Trump,2023-03-26,"""GOP Voters Keep Backing Trump Because He Hates the 'Right' People""","On a Saturday when dark clouds and even killer tornadoes were wending their way over huge swathes of the United States, the sun rose brightly over Waco. On a dusty patch of land in a central Texas town tagged by historic infamy, Donald Trump's army of supporters came early and in surprisingly large numbers on the first weekend of an uneasy American spring. In the shadow of massive pro-Trump flags—""Trump Or Death 1776 2024"" read one fastened to the front bumper of a blue Jeep—flew the undercurrent that the runaway front-runner for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination has sparked in a recent speech. Call it vengeance, or retribution, or old-fashioned smiting your enemies. On this day, Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg—the Black, progressive-minded prosecutor who may win an indictment of Trump as early as this week—was the new Public Enemy No. 1. ""Alvin Bragg is overstepping his boundaries,"" a man in a Trump hat, brandishing a T-shirt with a picture of the New York prosecutor reading ""ARREST ALVIN BRAGG,"" told a conservative news network. ""We the people are calling for the arrest of Alvin Bragg for crimes of treason and election interference—I don't even know if election interference is a crime—but election interference, obstruction of justice, even lying to a grand jury. Trump done nothing wrong. We're here to show support for the greatest president ever."" This random dude's words were echoed by the more powerful in attendance, such as Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, who increasingly sits at the right hand of House Speaker Kevin McCarthy. ""We have to stop allowing Democrats to abuse us,"" said Greene of Bragg, echoing the call for his arrest, while also calling him a puppet of Jewish billionaire George Soros in an antisemitic trope. She pled victimization: ""It's like we are a beaten spouse."" None — (@) Moments later, the jet rebranded as ""Trump Force One"" flew in for its dramatic landing, now accompanied by a favorite from the 1980s' Top Gun soundtrack. Kenny Loggins blared from the loudspeakers: ""Ride into the danger zone..."" Danger zone, indeed. Do not be fooled by the calming blue of a Texas big sky: the 747 of American democracy is flying on a collision course toward a steep mountainside. With the weight of four separate criminal probes dealing with Trump's outrageous behavior before, during and after his disastrous 45th presidency coming down on him, the hero of America's authoritarian right is gaining altitude in utter defiance of political gravity. With every headline about porn star payoffs, or threatening phone calls demanding that Georgia politicians find him votes, or a more aggressive federal investigation of his attempted coup on Jan. 6, 2021, Trump seems to rise another point or two in the polls—building a huge early lead in the race to win the GOP's 2024 White House nod. The only candidate who's shown signs of mounting an intraparty challenge—Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis—looks increasingly like a frozen deer on the Trump runway, unable to respond to attacks, caught between his me-too, Trump-lite policies and his need to appease traditional Republican fat cats and inside backers like Jeb Bush. No one knows how a scenario like this ends. But it clearly cannot end well. Will America really see a 2024 campaign where one party's leading candidate isn't jetting around to rallies on Trump Force One but instead is flown between courtrooms in New York, Atlanta, and Washington by armed marshals, wearing an ankle bracelet? And what if the Republican nominee is convicted? How serious to take Trump's prediction in a recent Truth Social post of ""potential death & destruction"" if he's charged? What to expect from fans vowing ""Trump or Death""? None — (@) ""They're not coming after me, they're coming after you,"" Trump said Saturday after ambling to the Waco stage, unveiling what ought to be his 2024 campaign slogan. The candidate's occasional rambles into policy—a likely abandonment of Ukraine's defense of democracy, or a fascist level of state control over the classroom—are not what this campaign is about. Trump's only real promise is a red wedding of revenge, against a ""deep state"" that ranges from the FBI to Covid bureaucrats, against the army of prosecutors who happen to be Black, against anybody really—school teachers and college professors, or white-coated doctors, or journalists—that people willing to stand for eight hours in Texas dust think are looking down on them. Why is this working? Don't ask the pundits who get paid a handsome six figures to talk about politics, who seem just as clueless today about Trump and, more importantly, his appeal—maybe more so—than when he cruised down that Trump Tower escalator in 2015. ""You know what I don't get, and I'm going to look stupid on TV for saying this, but I haven't gotten this for the last five or six years,"" John McWhorter, the Columbia University linguist and New York Times op-ed contributor, a frequent critic of the left, said recently on HBO's ""Real Time with Bill Maher."" ""Is it really true that there are really these people quote unquote sitting in diners with their hats on, et cetera, who are existentially upset that people like us in blue America look down on them? It seems to me most people aren't caring what the wider world thinks about them—they're buying their groceries... I don't believe they think about us."" John, you need to get out of the Upper West Side more often. They are absolutely thinking all the time about you, and your Columbia colleagues, and op-ed writers like me and you—even when you're intellectualizing their hatred of college campuses—and climate scientists and bureaucrats like Anthony Fauci (successful grandson of immigrants who once would have been lauded by conservatives) and of course lawyers like Alvin Bragg. Anyone who brandishes a diploma and tells them what they don't want to hear. Bonus points for anyone who tells them what they don't want to hear while Black, or while female. Their movement isn't defined by what they want but by whom they hate, and Donald Trump is the first politician who could articulate that rage with crude bluntness. I've spent a lot of time since the 2000s listening to people on the right—on my car radio, or at Tea Party gatherings and outside Trump rallies—and their message is pretty unambiguous. Their movement isn't defined by what they want but by whom they hate, and Donald Trump is the first politician who could articulate that rage with crude bluntness. McWhorter also said on HBO that Trump is ""charismatic,"" but he's not—not in the sense of JFK or the Gipper. It's only that he hates the right people, that he is the enemy of their enemy. For people fearful that whites or churchgoers are becoming a minority in America, or angry that cosmopolitan elites were redefining society as a rigged meritocracy where people without diplomas could be viewed as losers, Trump's hokey 2016 message that ""I am your voice"" resonated. But the perceived slights of the seven years since then—peaking in 2020 with the massive Black Lives Matter protests, the social controls needed to fight a pandemic, and Trump's Big Lie around his election defeat—have inspired 2023's much more dangerous message, that he is ""your retribution."" No wonder that Trump's looming potential indictments—by two Black big-city prosecutors that Fox News regularly blames for urban crime, and by the ""deep state"" of the U.S. Justice Department—are making him stronger by the day. No wonder his Waco throng stood with Trump in a sick musical celebration of the jailed thugs who attacked police officers in their Capitol Hill insurrection, Beer Hall Putsch martyrs for a new millennium. In an unreality zone called MSNBC, producers have reinvented the Trump saga as a political version of the O.J. Simpson trial—sometimes giving the whole hour to breathless coverage of the legal dramas for a shrinking audience in McWhorter's ""blue America."" Those viewers remain certain that Bragg or Jack Smith or Fani Willis will finally take down Trump despite seeing that the Access Hollywood tape and two impeachments and everything else did not. Here's what's real: American democracy has been in a doom loop ever since 2015. That's because the establishment keeps reaching into the traditional toolbox for the things—hard-hitting investigative reporting, congressional hearings, special prosecutors, and even impeachment—that always took down the bad guys of yesteryear, like Richard Nixon. The tools don't work on a movement based around hatred of journalists and prosecutors and even the FBI. Today, we stand on the banks of the Rubicon, and I would argue that the Alvin Braggs and Fani Willises and all of us treading water in a faith in democracy and the rule of law have no choice but to cross it. Prosecuting Donald Trump for both his high crimes and his misdemeanors is necessary to keep the republic—even if the consequence is some kind of ""Trump or Death"" civil war.

260,Trump,2023-03-30,"""'A Huge Deal for Accountability': New York Grand Jury Votes to Indict Donald Trump""","A Manhattan grand jury voted to indict former U.S. President Donald Trump for his role in a hush money payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, The New York Times reported Thursday, citing five people with knowledge of the matter. The grand jury's move makes Trump the first ex-president to face criminal charges—and comes as the 76-year-old is seeking the 2024 Republican presidential nomination. An indictment or even conviction in the case would not prevent him from running. After other outlets also confirmed the historic vote, a spokesperson for District Attorney Alvin Bragg said that ""this evening we contacted Mr. Trump's attorney to coordinate his surrender to the Manhattan DA's office for his arraignment on a [New York] Supreme Court indictment, which remains under seal. Guidance will be provided when the arraignment date is selected."" Citing two unnamed sources familiar with the case, CNN reported that Trump faces over 30 counts related to business fraud. ""Donald Trump has spent his entire political career dodging accountability for his wanton disregard for the law. It is finally catching up to him."" In a phone call with ABC News producer John Santucci, Trump said this is an ""attack on our country"" and ""political persecution,"" adding that ""they are trying to impact an election."" The twice-impeached former president made similar remarks in a lengthy statement. Asked by Santucci asked if he will turn himself in, Trump responded, ""You take care, John,"" and hung up. Trump attorney Joe Tacopina told NBC News that his client is expected to surrender to the DA's office early next week. Trump supporters expressed outrage over the development—as did Republican Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is expected to also run for the 2024 GOP presidential nomination but said Thursday that his state ""will not assist in an extradition request."" Despite warnings that this case ""is the first to result in an indictment, though arguably the toughest to win,"" as Mark Joseph Stern wrote for Slate, critics of Trump still welcomed the news as a long-awaited step toward accountability. \u201cDonald Trump was the most corrupt president in American history. He was the first president to be impeached twice, and now he\u2019s the first former president to be criminally indicted.\n\nTrump's corruption is finally catching up to him.\u201d — Citizens for Ethics (@Citizens for Ethics) 1680214108 ""We know of literally dozens of credible allegations of crimes committed by Donald Trump as president or running for it, with no charges filed. Until now,"" tweeted Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW). ""We can't yet evaluate these charges, but make no mistake, this is a huge deal for accountability."" ""Donald Trump has spent his entire political career dodging accountability for his wanton disregard for the law. It is finally catching up to him,"" Bookbinder added. ""The charges in New York are the first ever brought against him, but they will not be the last."" Congresswoman Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) similarly said ""this is just one of many criminal acts for which Donald Trump is being investigated. Make no mistake: the fact that one of the most powerful people in the world was investigated impartially and indicted is testament to the fact that we still live in a nation of laws. And no one is above the law."" Daniels has alleged that she had an extramarital sexual affair with Trump, which he denies. Daniels' attorney, Clark Brewster, said that ""the indictment of Donald Trump is no cause for joy. The hard work and conscientiousness of the grand jurors must be respected. Now let truth and justice prevail. No one is above the law."" Trump's former fixer Michael Cohen, who made a $130,000 payment to Daniels, said Thursday that ""accountability matters and I stand by my testimony and the evidence I have provided"" to the district attorney. Aaron Scherb, senior director of legislative affairs at Common Cause, pointed to Cohen's prison time on Thursday. ""No American is above the law, including former presidents, and Donald Trump will get his day in court,"" said Scherb. ""Donald Trump and his co-conspirators clearly appeared to have broken the law and his attorney at the time has already served time in federal prison for charges related to the $130,000 hush money payout.

Urging secretaries of state and chief election officials across the country to ""do their job,"" Bonifaz said that ""the insurrectionist disqualification clause of the 14th Amendment makes clear that Trump is disqualified from holding any future public office based on his role in inciting and mobilizing the January 6th insurrection.""

345,Trump,2023-03-31,"""Rebutting 3 GOP Talking Points on Trump Indictment""","Donald Trump has been indicted.You’re going to hear three basic criticisms of this indictment. Let me rebut each in turn.1. It sets a dangerous precedent.Rubbish. In order for the justice system to work, there must be trust that the system will not play favorites or ignore the wrongdoing of the powerful.Donald Trump has done everything possible over the last seven years to destroy that trust for his own political gain.Since the basic issue here is one of accountability, this case could actually open the way for the other, more serious ones.It is true that no former president has ever been indicted, but no former president has done what Donald Trump has done — repeatedly defied laws and disregarded the U.S. Constitution. America never quite recovered from Gerald Ford’s decision to pardon Richard Nixon for all crimes he might have committed. The Framers of the Constitution explicitly provided that presidents could be charged after leaving office. Article I Section 3 states that a president impeached by the House and convicted and removed from office by the Senate “shall nevertheless be liable and subject to indictment, trial, judgment and punishment, according to law.”The fundamental idea that no one is above the law is only true if we make it so. Holding our leaders accountable is vital to maintaining trust in our legal system, and the survival of our democracy itself.2. The indictment plays into Trump’s claims that he’s the victim of a witch hunt and will further rile his core supporters Irrelevant. Undoubtedly some Trump supporters will be upset by this. The indictment will confirm for them that Trump is not only being prosecuted but also being persecuted. But Trump has used every move against him so far — whether by the FBI, the Justice Department, Congress, or even opponents in the Republican Party — to claim he’s the victim of a witch hunt. This indictment is not fundamentally different from all the other charges and allegations. His entire campaign is founded on variations of this same grievance. But in this case, a grand jury has found that he broke the law. It will be harder to cast an independent grand jury composed of ordinary people as part of a “deep state” witch hunt.3. This is the weakest of the cases now being prepared against Trump So what? To be sure, paying hush money to cover up something embarrassing during a presidential campaign is not nearly on the same level as asking Georgia’s secretary of state to “come up” with the exact number of votes needed to reverse the outcome of Georgia’s presidential election, or fomenting an attack on the U.S. Capitol. And it may be true that an allegation like this is usually treated as a misdemeanor rather than a felony. None of this alters the fact that a grand jury had enough evidence in this case to decide that Trump broke the law. That’s the critical point. A federal judge can decide whether the case rises to a felony or is more appropriately treated as a misdemeanor. The overriding issue is that no person is above the law, not even a former president.Indeed, since the basic issue here is one of accountability, this case could actually open the way for the other, more serious ones. Prosecutors in Georgia and Washington won’t have to bear the burden of justifying an action that had never been taken before. Their more serious charges would come to a public that had already adjusted to the phenomenon of a Trump indictment.",Common Dreams,Top,Yes,44.66882362055463,60.07237517762013,99.96380317802134,6.225917365650677,60.38131174195964,72.34010415790833,gop points,{},"{'criticisms': 'basic', 'precedent': 'dangerous', 'years': 'last', 'gain': 'political', 'issue': 'basic', 'ones': 'serious', 'president': 'former', 'idea': 'fundamental', 'system': 'legal', 'charges': 'serious', 'campaign': 'presidential', 'grievance': 'same', 'jury': 'grand', 'people': 'ordinary', 'state': 'deep', 'money': 'hush', 'level': 'same', 'number': 'exact', 'election': 'presidential', 'evidence': 'enough', 'point': 'critical', 'judge': 'federal'}",0,1

And it’s not the confab two months later between that same adult child—Donald Trump Jr.—and members of Middle East royalty, who were also offering election assistance.This meeting came before all of that—in August 2015.

569,Trump,2023-04-05,"""Beware a Media Once Again Hypnotized by the Trump Spectacle""","At the criminal court in downtown Manhattan today, nothing important happened. Believe me. I was there. There were no meaningful occurrences of true consequence. Certainly nothing worthy of a claim on your limited attention. I wouldn't bring it up at all, except that I fear that my friends and I in the media may be about to gleefully poison this nation, one more time. One thing about New York City is that it is home to a large population of reporters, of which I am one, that will reliably turn up at any spectacle. Not out of any nefarious motives. We do this for the same reason that residents of small towns turn up at the county fair: It's something to do. Media is a two-way entertainment business. In order to entertain our audience, we must first be entertained ourselves. Spectacles, therefore, are irresistible. This is okay, even amusing, until the weight of a spectacle grows so large and monopolizes so much of the available energy that it starts feeding itself, investing itself with undue importance purely because everyone is paying it so much attention. Such was the case with the media circus around the arraignment of former President Donald J. Trump over hush money payments to porn star Stormy Daniels. Like drinking an entire bottle of vodka, this can all seem like great fun, until you wake up and find that everything around you has been broken. On Tuesday morning, the east side of Collect Pond Park across the street from the courthouse was lined with tents, each one home to a camera crew from a different national news organization. Many of those cameras were trained on a guy in a breakdancing-style track suit who was spinning a basketball on top of a pole holding an American flag, as he danced back and forth in Rollerblades chanting ""Donald. J. Trump. Not. Guilty!"" He seemed to be the most newsworthy thing out there. The park itself, which was ostensibly the site of a protest, was jammed with a crowd that was about 80% press, 15% police and 5% people who had come to protest or counterprotest on one side or the other. Any lunatic who wanted to don a MAGA hat or wave a ""FUCK TRUMP"" flag and make their way downtown was likely to be photographed and patiently interviewed by multiple power-suited TV newspeople who would nod and maintain a look of professionalism, no matter how stupid the words flowing from the person's mouth were. One man wearing an orange prison jumpsuit and a rubber Trump mask told a reporter, with great seriousness, ""I don't really give interviews, because I don't sound like him."" We, the press, were all here, and we needed content. There was no one to blame but ourselves. Even the Proud Boys and antifa, usually reliable telegenic opponents on the field of pointless political battle, did not bother showing up to this event, leaving the desperate reporters crowding around a single guy with a Trump hat on his head and a small dog in a cart at his side. At last, Marjorie Taylor Greene, the bombastic Georgia fool (and Republican House representative), showed up to give her speech. Or so I was told. Though I was only feet away from her alleged location, I could not see her through the tightly packed forest of cameras, and I could not hear her thanks to one determined opponent who continually blew an orange plastic whistle as long as she was speaking. Eventually her security detail pushed through the chaotic crowd and the person I assume to be Greene left the park, trailing a cloud of media like a comet's tail. After that, there was nothing much left except the freaks and predators astute enough to come and sponge up the free press. New York Rep. Jamal Bowman was there, saying some things, along with a performance artist who smeared white paint all over her skin and screamed ""Fuck white people!"" until the police strongly encouraged her to leave the park. Here and there, some die-hard MAGA people who had come in to support their pagan god milled about, looking a little aimless. I asked two women from Texas wearing Trump t-shirts where else they planned to go in the big city after the rally. ""Probably nowhere,"" one said. ""I'm not risking my life to be out in New York City. You all have rapes, murders, right in the streets here, with Bragg letting all the criminals go."" This was pure delusion. It's true that waltzing around New York in a Trump hat puts you at risk for public humiliation, but other than that, it's a pretty safe city. It's easy to lay this sort of thinking at the doorstep of Fox News, but if we are being honest, your local news can produce this same sort of fearful hallucination on a local scale. There are plenty of important things happening in America right now. Florida has just effectively banned abortion. Vital elections are taking place in Chicago and Wisconsin. In Los Angeles, a labor dispute threatens to shut down Hollywood. All of these things will have a profound material impact on millions of people's lives. The hundreds of reporters in Manhattan today were not covering any of these things. They were covering the guy on rollerblades instead. We will never know how many more important stories did not get told because we were all out in this park full of cretins. Some will say, ""Isn't the historic arraignment of a former United States President important as well?"" And I say to you: No. It's not. Not really. Donald Trump walking in and getting his mug shot taken is not important in the same way that a woman in Florida being forced to have a baby she doesn't want due to the brutal and cowardly actions of her state's elected leaders is important. A single pool reporter with a notebook and an iPhone could cover the Trump arraignment just as effectively as dozens of CNN satellite teams can, because there is not really very much happening, when you get right down to it. I don't want to be an old crank here. I like spectacle. I am a reporter on the far margins of national news, and that is where spectacle belongs. It is worth making this point very clearly, before the 2024 presidential campaign season really gets cooking. It's not too late to correct our course here. The press had many grave, chin-stroking panels about lessons learned after our hypnotic fascination with Trump's every last bleat ushered him into the White House atop a pile of free media coverage. But if today was any indication, the hypnotism is just as strong as ever.

But organizations working to elect Democrats are inhabiting a parallel political reality—one where Trump’s indictment is a golden opportunity to fill their campaign coffers with cash and curry favor with the party’s fervently anti-Trump base.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,Yes,50.59222842401485,77.34903048049281,99.53384217994794,60.25214119779495,64.01797584329032,91.77107757336258,somber dems,{},"{'week': 'last', 'politicians': 'democratic', 'indictment': 'criminal', 'president': 'former', 'occasion': 'somber', 'leadership': 'democratic', 'gain': 'partisan', 'reality': 'political', 'opportunity': 'golden', 'base': 'trump'}",1,1

606,Trump,2023-04-06,"""Trump's Indictment: A Wakeup Call for Resurrecting Democracy""","Donald Trump's indictment for criminal behavior has no precedent in American history. How could a functioning democracy choose such a man as President? There's the rub. Trump was not elected in a functioning democracy. Ronald Reagan and a toxic Supreme Court signed its death warrant years ago. In his manic neoliberal drive to deregulate the economy Reagan suspended enforcement of the anti-trust laws. The resulting frenzy of mergers and acquisitions concentrated every American industry into a small handful of titanic corporations. Supreme Court decisions endowed these corporations with Constitutional rights of personhood, and declared spending money a form of free speech. As the 20th century faded, consequently, a tsunami of corporate money defeated American democracy, displacing it with a de facto corporate oligarchy—which then retained the Republican Party as its champion. The money flows in two channels: corporate campaign contributions precondition elected officials to be friendly and accommodating listeners, and then corporate lobbyists articulate the detailed requests. As a result public policy today systematically favors corporate interests, over the welfare of the American people. Yes, a veneer of democracy remains. We vote people into office, but who controls the policy outcomes? It wasn't the will of the people to repeal Glass-Steagall in the 1990's; the Wall Street banks were delighted. It wasn't the will of the people to invade Iraq in 2003; the oil and armaments industries were delighted. It wasn't the will of the people to cut the corporate tax rate by 40% in Trump's Tax Cut and Jobs Act of 2017; every corporation in America was delirious. In every case the nation suffered, as massive wealth was shifted upward. The wellspring of corporate oligarchy was the ""Powell Manifesto,"" written by corporate attorney Lewis Powell, and published in 1971 by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. The Manifesto was a neoliberal creed, condemning government interventions in free markets and praising the efficacy of private enterprise. It was so appealing to corporate America Joseph Coors immediately founded the Heritage Foundation with a grant of $250,000, the Koch Brothers doubled that in setting up the Cato Institute, and a moribund rightwing research shop was transformed into the American Enterprise Institute. Since then these three think tanks have dominated the thinking, policy positions, and even staffing of Republican Administrations. They also demonstrated the appeal of neoliberalism in presidential campaigns The Democratic Leadership Council embraced neoliberalism in 1992 and put Bill Clinton in the White House, to announce ""the end of welfare as we know it"" and ""the era of big government is over."" The Powell Manifesto, then, succeeded in normalizing and popularizing neoliberalism. But corporate oligarchy was not yet possible: corporations were prohibited from contributing to political campaigns, by the Tillman Act of 1907. Lewis Powell was up to the challenge. In 1972 President Richard Nixon appointed Powell to the Supreme Court. Four years later the Court heard the case of Buckley v. Valeo. Powell voted with the majority, to establish in law that candidates spending money for political campaigns is a form of free speech, protected by the First Amendment. Two years later, in First National Bank of Boston v. Bellotti, Powell wrote the majority decision: speaking freely by spending money is the Constitutional right of corporations as well. But corporate oligarchy was still beyond reach, because corporations in America were very small, very many, and very much in competition with each other, industry by industry. Few of them could afford to spend much on political campaigns, or lobbying. Until Ronald Reagan encouraged them to buy up their competitors, aggregating pools of financial resources of unprecedented magnitude. Corporate oligarchy blossomed and brought with it the disastrous consequences: a shrinking middle class, hunger, homelessness, a floundering healthcare system, unending warfare, crumbling public education, savaged labor unions, a climate crisis, a tiny stratum of obscene wealth and growing poverty for everyone else. The drivers and the history of corporate oligarchy are well known and documented and have been for years. In 1992 William Greider pioneered the alarms, with his book, Who Will Tell the People? The Betrayal of American Democracy. David Korten's book followed in 1995: When Corporations Rule the World. In 2004 Lisa Duggans' book appeared: The Twilight of Equality? Neoliberalism, Cultural Politics, and the Attack on Democracy. More recently Daniel Lucks' work appeared: Reconsidering Reagan: Racism, Republicans, and the Road to Trump, in 2020. Thom Hartmann's book in 2019 is entitled, The Hidden History of the Supreme Court and the Betrayal of American Democracy. A companion volume followed in 2022, The Hidden History of Neoliberalism: How Reaganism Gutted America and How to Restore Its Greatness. Such books, and periodicals, radio talk-shows, and progressive websites have developed a groundswell of resistance intent on restoring democracy. Trump's indictment is an optimistic sign. It constitutes an inflection point, the first direct challenge to corporate oligarchy. The Republican Party is more than outraged: it is terrified, and so are the party's masters, the billionaire and corporate oligarchs. Donald Trump is critical to their prosperity and to their future. Ever more clearly the Republican Party is pushing the country into fascism, and to be firmly implanted fascism requires, indispensably, a charismatic demagogue. Donald Trump displayed his genius as such in his campaign for the White House and in his subsequent and frequent rallies. No one visible in the country today can match him: Trump must survive. For the Republican Party and its benefactors, losing Trump means losing the ballgame. The ballgame is in jeopardy. Almost certainly Trump's indictment on the hush-money issue presages more indictments to follow, on far more serious charges, at the hands of Fani Willis in Georgia and Special Counsel Jack Smith at the Justice Department. The trials will stretch on for months, exposing Trump's actions and his persona to public scrutiny day after day: his support is far more likely to erode than to expand. This is fortunate; the 2024 presidential election looms, and it will be arguably the most critical in modern history. We will not likely see Trump in the White House again, and hence will escape a charismatic demagogue and full-strength fascism. But any of Trump's Republican competitors, if elected, will cement corporate oligarchy in place. If the resurrection of democracy is to proceed, a Republican Administration is unthinkable.

Jim Jordan, who as chair of the House Judiciary Committee has launched numerous attempts to interfere with the prosecution of former Republican President Donald Trump. The lawsuit was filed a week after Bragg's office charged Trump with 34 felony counts stemming from his alleged ""hush money"" payment to adult film star Stormy Daniels during the 2016 presidential election.Jordan responded to the charges by issuing a subpoena to a former investigator in Bragg's office, Mark Pomerantz, calling on him to provide the Ohio Republican's committee with a closed-door deposition about the probe into Trump's alleged crimes.The subpoena amounted to a ""brazen and unconstitutional attack"" by a close ally of Trump who is intent on waging a ""transparent campaign to intimidate"" the district attorney's office, Bragg's lawyers said in the lawsuit, which was filed in the Southern District of New York. Bragg is seeking to bar Jordan from enforcing the subpoena and from demanding testimony from anyone else, including the district attorney himself.""Rather than allowing the criminal process to proceed in the ordinary course, Chairman Jordan and the committee are participating in a campaign of intimidation, retaliation, and obstruction,"" reads the lawsuit. In addition to the subpoena, Jordan—along with Reps. James Comer (R-Ky.) and Bryan Steil (R-Wis.), who respectively chair the House Oversight, and Administration committees—sent letters last month to Bragg's office demanding documents regarding the investigation into Trump, claiming the House Judiciary Committee has the authority to oversee the case.""Usually Republicans want a weak federal government,"" Maya Wiley, president of the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights, said Tuesday.

However, access to medication abortion remains at ""severe risk."" That was the message Friday from reproductive rights advocates after the United States Supreme Court temporarily blocked a ruling by a Texas federal judge that would effectively end access to abortion pills. Justice Samuel Alito issued a short order on the high court's ""shadow docket"" staying until next Wednesday last week's decision by U.S. 5th Circuit Judge Matthew Kacsmaryk, an appointee of former President Donald Trump who ruled that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration's 2000 approval of mifepristone—one of two drugs typically used in tandem to induce abortion—was illegal. \u201cThis is such important news.\n\nMifepristone remains safe, effective, and AVAILABLE.\u201d — Progressive Caucus (@Progressive Caucus) 1681502385 Alito, who wrote the majority opinion in Dobbs v.

""While medication abortion remains accessible for now, this case should never have been heard in the first place,"" NARAL Pro-Choice America president Minni Timmaraju said in a statement. ""Nothing about the rulings from the lower courts' Trump-appointed judges had any basis in medical science–both are steeped in reckless disinformation and total disregard for the law. As this case continues, safe and effective medication abortion in all 50 states is at severe risk."" Jenny Ma, senior counsel at the Center for Reproductive Rights, said Friday that ""mifepristone will remain available as it has for the last 23 years, for at least five more days."" ""This week has created whiplash for healthcare providers and patients—and this order provides cold comfort for a brief few days,"" Ma added. ""But this case is far from over.

""The court rightly found that some claims were filed too late,"" Northup added, ""but that should not distract from the radical assault on the FDA's decision-making authority and the fact that it will wreak havoc on the provision of medication abortion if it stands."" The full Supreme Court next week is expected to consider granting a longer stay of Kacsmaryk's decision.

Ron DeSantis on the closest thing to a policy difference the 2024 GOP primary might see.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,Yes,49.9184503946978,97.90988623844984,99.21009828122936,54.10674276009243,65.93052256797397,71.86098238393335,trump new,{},"{'stages': 'early', 'nomination': 'presidential', 'insults': 'personal', 'tool': 'rare', 'wedge': 'proverbial', 'policy': 'public', 'enemy': 'shared', 'programs': 'same', 'thing': 'closest'}",1,1

748,Trump,2023-04-21,"""Fox's Settlement With Dominion Shows That 'Lies Have Consequences'""","When was the last time you forked over nearly $800 million? Really think. There must have been some moment, some dispute where you decided to reach deep within your checking account to find the better part of a billion dollars—a dispute where you weren't wrong, but you wanted to end things the easy way. Well, Fox News knows the feeling. While the United States braced to watch a sure-to-be-fascinating defamation trial between Rupert Murdoch's prized cable news channel and Dominion Voting Systems—which alleged that Fox had repeatedly aired false claims that it fixed the 2020 presidential race for Joe Biden—the two parties reached a settlement. The $787.5 million is about half of the $1.6 billion the election technology company demanded. ""Fox News' $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in U.S. history involving a media company."" Nevertheless, as CNN (4/18/23) reported, ""Fox News' $787.5 million settlement with Dominion Voting Systems is the largest publicly known defamation settlement in U.S. history involving a media company."" It amounts to 5.5% of total revenue of the Fox Corporation, Fox News' parent company, for all of 2022. It's still less than what Alex Jones of Infowars was forced to pay after a court found that he had repeatedly defamed the parents of the Sandy Hook shooting victims for faking the massacre (Independent, 9/15/22; AP, 10/12/22). And this wasn't Dominion's first settlement regarding false election claims: Newsmax, a network that's sort of like Fox News on crystal meth, settled a similar lawsuit with Dominion two years ago (Business Insider, 4/20/21). Fox's critics are disappointed; the network gets to keep its dirty laundry out of the light, and it still retains its place as the go-to right-wing cable news source (Atlantic, 4/19/23). On the other hand, Dominion attorney Justin Nelson (Deadline, 4/18/23) told reporters: ""The truth matters. Lies have consequences,"" and that the settlement ""represents vindication and accountability."" Tough legal road On the face of it, Fox had one big thing on its side going into the trial. The 1964 Supreme Court decision New York Times v. Sullivan holds that a plaintiff who's a public figure must show ""actual malice"" in order to prove libel, which means the defendant must have known that the defamatory statement was false, or else showed ""reckless disregard for the truth."" This is a tough standard to meet in court, and one that we've defended at FAIR (3/26/21, 2/25/22, 3/1/23, 3/10/23) against conservative calls to overturn the decision. But it does not seem to have been too tough for Dominion to meet. It appears that the Fox lawyers, taking a look at the jury, smelling the wooden air of the courtroom, and looking at all the discovery documents showing that Fox hosts knew what they were airing was bunk, said to themselves, ""We're not going to win this one."" They had good reason to be nervous. At the beginning of the trial, the network apologized to Judge Eric Davis, who is overseeing the case, after he said the network ""made misrepresentations to the court and delayed turning over evidence"" (ABC, 4/15/23). Fox News host Howard Kurtz tweeted (4/16/23): ""Judge knocks down some of [Fox's] key defenses, sanctions the network and suggests an investigation."" Observers forecast a tough legal road for Fox. The New York Times (4/6/23) said that ""a number of well-regarded First Amendment lawyers have called the Dominion case among the strongest they have ever seen,"" because the documents produced in discovery go far in establishing that people on virtually every level of the company knew that the allegations about Dominion were wrong yet for weeks did nothing to cut them off. LA Times legal affairs columnist Harry Litman (2/21/23) wrote that Dominion's case was ""unusually strong."" ""Defamation suits often concern the work of careless or sensationalist reporters slipping past fact-checking safeguards,"" he noted. However, the allegations in this case had threatened to ""lay bare a deliberate corporate decision to ignore the truth and publish lies."" At Bloomberg (3/18/23), Noah Feldman balanced the necessity of protecting press freedom and holding press outlets accountable, saying that courts should strive to ""preserve the core idea behind the law of libel: that no one, not even the media speaking about a public figure on a newsworthy topic, may knowingly repeat defamatory lies as statements of fact."" Feldman added that if we abandon that basic idea, we will launch public discourse into a fully fact-free zone. Donald Trump has already done his best to put us there. The courts and the Constitution should not give him an after-the-fact victory. In-house cheering squad And yet Murdoch's empire, as well as some other conservative journalists, had spoken publicly in the network's defense, seemingly convinced of Fox's blamelessness. William Barr, former attorney general under George H. W. Bush and Donald Trump, assured readers of the Murdoch-owned Wall Street Journal (3/23/23) that the case against Fox, before the trial, was weak, because ""it isn't defamatory for journalists to report on newsworthy allegations made by others, even when those allegations turn out to be false."" (In fact, reporters who repeat defamatory falsehoods are often committing libel, though there are exceptions to this general rule—Volokh Conspiracy, 11/7/18.) Washington Post media writer Erik Wemple noted that Fox even publicly scoffed at the lawsuit last year in its annual report (Twitter, 4/19/23). The idea that it's been proven that Fox aired false accusations ""is virtually gospel among American liberals,"" complained Glenn Greenwald (System Update, 3/3/23), a frequent guest on Fox's Tucker Carlson Tonight. ""As usual, these corporate media outlets""—as though Fox were somehow not corporate, or not a media outlet—""along with Democratic Party leaders, are marching in total lockstep, and none has aired any skepticism or questioning of this accusatory framework."" The Murdoch-owned New York Post editorial board (4/17/23) pulled an ""I know you are but what am I?"" routine in regards to the Dominion case, saying that the New York Times ran ""endless Russia, Russia, Russia stories"" about 2016 election interference (AP, 4/21/20), as well as the 1619 Project (8/14/19), which it called a Pulitzer-winning disinfo push hawking the factually inaccurate idea that the American Revolution was undertaken primarily to preserve the slaveholding rights of Southern colonies. There's some difference between allegations of defamation and a controversial interpretation of U.S. history. Who does the Post think should sue the Times for damages over the 1619 Project, the ghost of James Madison? The Post went on, ""How many internal emails from the Times' own newsroom would express private concerns over coverage, even as bogus stories are rushed into print to juice subscription revenues?"" That's actually a fair question, especially when you consider the Times' coverage of the lead-up to the Iraq War (FAIR.org, 3/22/23). However, that still doesn't vindicate Fox. No need to weaken press protection These defenses seem laughable now that Fox has decided to part with the equivalent of the gross domestic product of Samoa in order to keep its dirty laundry out of the public eye. Interestingly, though, Barr's defense of Fox got one thing right when he said, ""Conservatives shouldn't try to weaken the actual-malice standard""—which is something, as mentioned earlier, many conservatives want to do. In fact, some right-wing outlets are already warning the Florida Republican Gov. Ron DeSantis' effort to challenge Sullivan could backfire, because, as the New York Times (4/3/23) put it, it ""would affect right-wing reporters and commentators, not just the mainstream outlets that have become punching bags for Republican politicians."" But what Barr, and the other Fox defenders, didn't quite understand is that there can be some measure of accountability for victims of defamation by right-wing rage machines like Fox without sacrificing free press rights.

772,Trump,2023-04-24,"""Grandpa, Tell Me About the Time the Supreme Court Picked a Fight With the Future""","Major media outlets often describe the six justices who make up the far-right majority on the Supreme Court simply as conservatives, but they are much more than that. In a very real sense, they are revolutionaries, kindred spirits who are using their judicial power to remake America. And the fact a majority of Americans don't approve isn't slowing them down. These six justices have strikingly similar judicial outlooks. Why wouldn't they? They all came of age as lawyers as part of the same Federalist Society clan. These are people who were bred from their earliest days in the law to be precisely what they are—ideological combatants, united in purpose, playing the role of judges. And when this united commitment is combined with the paucity of practical checks on judicial power, these six people are able to exercise something shockingly close to a dictatorial level of power. The powers of the other, supposedly coequal, branches of government are chicken feed by comparison. The president, of course, exercises great power, but in a contest between the president and the Supreme Court, the Court always wins. The Court's primacy is baked in by the judicially created doctrine of judicial review. Congress can pass statutes. The president can sign them. But if the Supreme Court decides any of those statutes, or for that matter regulations or other governmental actions, are unconstitutional—it's game, set, and match. By installing a Supreme Court prepared to constitutionalize right-wing dogma, the political right is stripping the generations that follow them of the freedom to decide for themselves what sort of society they will strive to achieve. American democracy is in trouble. The reasons are many— extreme gerrymandering, voter suppression, unlimited (and often undisclosed) oceans of cash, much of it from billionaires and corporations. But these Supreme-Court-endorsed roadblocks to a functional democracy, as bad as they are, only go so far. If enough voters get mad enough, there is, at least for now, still enough small d democratic in our democracy to bring about change. Decisions of the Supreme Court that are based on the Constitution, on the other hand, are unassailable. The retort to this is that judicial decisions can be overturned by constitutional amendments. Supreme Court justices can be impeached. For that matter, the president and Senate have the power to increase the size of the Court and thereby change its ideological bent. All of these potential checks on judicial overreach are enshrined in the Constitution. But anyone with an ounce of intellectual honesty has to concede none of them are politically realistic options in anything short of the most extreme situations imaginable. A good example of the political impossibility of using these devices to restrain a runaway judiciary is playing out now in the scandal surrounding Justice Clarence Thomas. We all know how this will end. Thomas will stand firm, and eventually everyone will move on. We can scream all we want that Abe Fortas, a liberal justice, was forced to resign for far less egregious conduct. Indeed, many Democrats joined in the calls for him to resign despite the fact Richard Nixon, who was certain to nominate a Republican replacement, was president. But we live in a different world today. It wouldn't matter if, to borrow Donald Trump's words, Justice Thomas was to ""stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody."" The GOP would stand behind him. Thomas is their man and their vote on the Court. And they won't give that up, not with a Democratic president positioned to nominate the replacement. They didn't steal a Supreme Court seat from Barack Obama just to give it back now. If you're still not convinced that these checks on judicial power are politically implausible today, remember what a somewhat less extreme Republican Court majority got away with in 2000 in deciding Bush v. Gore. Given the choice between letting a recount play out to see who actually won or simply installing George W. Bush as president, they went with Bush, the candidate they favored. No serious legal scholar even tries to defend the rationale applied by the Court. Even Richard Posner, who acted as the Supreme Court's chief defender after the decision, admitted the Court's use of equal protection to decide the case was indefensible. But they got away with it, suffering no long-term damage other than a few scratches to the Court's reputation. And none of these supposed remedies were ever even seriously considered. Bush then used the power thus given him to nominate two more right-wing justices, thereby solidifying the right's dominance on the Court. So armed, the newly invigorated and increasingly extreme Court upheld restrictions on voting rights, struck down part of the Voting Rights Act, and opened the door to limitless infusion of corporate cash into the political process. None of this would have happened if Al Gore hadn't been torpedoed by the Supreme Court and been in office to make the appointments. And without these antidemocratic rulings, there is little doubt Donald Trump would have lost to Hillary Clinton in 2016. This, of course, is the same Donald Trump who then put three more extreme-right-wing justices onto the Court, thereby likely cementing the far-right's dominance for decades. In short, the far-right justices helped build their own majority—and paid no real price for it. But as they say, pride goeth before a fall. And ironically, it is this far-right dominance that makes it all but inevitable that a titanic battle, one likely to be damaging to the Court, is going to occur between the Court and a younger, mostly progressive, generation with an agenda of its own. An agenda that will put it in direct conflict with an activist Supreme Court. What is happening here is nothing less than an attack by the old against the young. By installing a Supreme Court prepared to constitutionalize right-wing dogma, the political right is stripping the generations that follow them of the freedom to decide for themselves what sort of society they will strive to achieve. By all indications, the clear majority of this younger generation will work to create a society with fewer guns, more action on climate change, and greater guarantees of respect for diversity. But they'll quickly find themselves stopped cold—effectively told, ""Be silent, children, Justice Alito will decide for you."" Millennials and Gen Zers will be asked to accept a situation in which, for decades to come, politically inspired legal opinions will prevent them from making changes a majority of them believe necessary in order to form a more perfect union. There is every reason to believe their answer will be no. And here's something those six far-right justices might want to consider.

This is a mistake on Trump’s part and unlikely to go over well with the jury. After all, they have to be there because of him so why shouldn’t he be there?As a former sex crimes prosecutor, it’s my experience that juries take their obligations in allegations of sexual assault very seriously and work conscientiously to objectively and dispassionately evaluate the evidence each case.

828,Trump,2023-04-28,"""E. Jean Carroll and Other Survivors Don't Need an Excuse for Not Screaming""","The E. Jean Carroll vs. Donald Trump rape trial is, no doubt, eliciting a lot of understandable reactions in sexual assault survivors.* I'm a psychotherapist who, for years, has been privileged to work with many survivors. I used to consult to a rape crisis center. I don't need to hear one word of a trauma story to do trauma work, but I've heard countless stories. Stories of hope, of shame, of fear, of anger, of grief and betrayal. Stories of atrocious violence. Stories of glorious resilience. I've watched police be respectful and kind to someone as they're reporting their assault. I've also seen police be dismissive and blaming and horrible, forcing a person, often still in what is colloquially known as shock, to prove that the ""encounter"" was not consensual or that she was no somehow ""asking for it."" I've witnessed people become ""disgusted"" with their partners who were assaulted, and so they leave or divorce such ""damaged goods."" I've heard how friends no longer know how to talk to a person, treating them like they're fragile beyond measure or as if they're contagious and if you get too close then you'll somehow become infected. I've known employers who fired their employees because they didn't have a ""legitimate"" reason for taking time off from work to process and integrate such a fragmenting experience. I've heard how people have been excommunicated from previously close-knit families or neighborhoods because they dared to name that an uncle or a brother or a woman down the street was their perpetrator. There have been beautiful stories of solidarity and support, too. But all too often, contending with the shaming, cruel reactions from others adds very real trauma on top of trauma. On the stand, E. Jean Carroll talked about what happened after she publicly accused Trump: ""Oh. My God. The force of hatred coming at me was staggering."" Even more trauma comes from being judged for what one did during the assault or right afterward. ""Why didn't they run?"" ""Why didn't he fight?"" ""How could she possibly laugh??"" Those questions all belie a total and complete ignorance of the mechanisms of trauma and millennia of nervous system evolution. Our survival strategies kick in, and, more often than not, we don't have time for conscious decision making; it just happens. In a split second, our nervous systems assess the threat and take the best course of action available. (This is why we don't take a moment to think through the pros and cons of, say, jumping out of the way of an oncoming car, or we'd be toast. We just automatically do it.) Sometimes we're able to run away when someone tries to sexually assault us. Sometimes we can fight or scream, but often that isn't the best survival strategy because that can escalate life threatening violence and retaliation. And so, it's a really bad idea. Or maybe it's so ingrained in us to be a ""good girl"" that screaming doesn't even occur to us, especially if the assailant is someone we know, which is most often the case. Much less talked about are the survival responses of compliance and appeasement. Those have saved many a life, and thank God for that. I hope all of us have access to those survival strategies, if needed. To judge those last two as ""weak,"" or decide a survivor is partly to blame because they were compliant or appeasing, or to insist you'd do [fill in the blank] were someone sexually assaulting you, is preposterous. Maybe you would and maybe you wouldn't. Again, our nervous systems automatically kick into gear and do what they have to do to survive: fight, flee, comply, appease, or even all-but collapse or ""play dead."" In this instance, you might totally check out, go passive and limp to get through it. And so, you barely remember what happened, cognitively, but somatically you sure as hell know. Again, hooray that our nervous systems have that survival strategy available, too! Then there's what happens right afterward. You might not go to the police (especially if you're part of a group that has historically been oppressed by them). You might not call a rape crisis center or a friend. Maybe you laugh uncontrollably, disoriented, incredulous at the surreal thing that just happened. People anxiously or disconnectedly laugh at horrible things that have happened to them. I see it all the time in my practice. Maybe you go back to a party, ignoring for the moment what just happened. Maybe you go shopping for dinner. ""Everything's cool. Yup, all normal. Just fine."" Maybe you pick a huge, screaming fight with your partner in an unconscious effort to fend off the feelings of vulnerability. None of that is ""weird"" or unexplainable. You're in shock. Your nervous system hasn't had near enough time to integrate or process what just happened. You're on auto pilot. You might do things that seem to make no sense. But they do if you understand trauma. Given all these layers and sequelae of trauma, I get why many survivors never come forward. It's a big risk. Once your story is out there, it's out there. Even supportive people tend to look at you through the filter of: The One Who Was Raped. On the stand, E. Jean Carroll talked about what happened after she publicly accused Trump: ""Oh. My God. The force of hatred coming at me was staggering."" That onslaught is, again, more trauma on top of trauma. So is, potentially, Trump's lead counsel Joe Tacopina's line of questioning about Carroll not screaming as she was being sexually assaulted. ""He raped me, whether I screamed or not. I don't need any excuse for not screaming."" Indeed, she doesn't. I can't say this too many times: Wondering or questioning why Carroll didn't scream or run or why she laughed or soon went back to work shows a total ignorance of trauma and how nervous systems work. We can't override evolution as much as we might try. Full stop. I get that in a courtroom you need a jury to believe you, but generally you don't need to justify anything to anyone. If people don't believe you, that's about them. And their ignorance or fear or discomfort. As Carroll has, many do come forward years or decades later. Again, the accusatory cries of, ""Why didn't she come forward earlier?"" are absolutely uninformed. Maybe that's the time your nervous system needed to work through the trauma be it via trauma-informed therapy or self-exploration or gardening; or maybe the perpetrator finally moved or died; or maybe enough time has passed where your family is able to be supportive and not abandon you for calling out your uncle; or maybe enough is enough and you just can't stay silent a day longer. Many finally felt the validation and the safety in numbers of the #MeToo movement that allowed them to come forward. All the doubting questions ignore that in 2023 we still live in a patriarchal culture. It's a culture that continues to judge and shame and doubt and blame women for their sexual assault, or those questions would never be asked in the first place. And when other genders get assaulted, that comes with its own kind of judgment. And if you're a person of color, add another layer on top of that. It can take a huge amount of bravery and fortitude just to get up and face a run-of-the-mill day after such a disorienting, devastating experience that robs one of a sense of safety no matter where you are because your body is the scene of the crime. Confronting a perpetrator requires its own kind of bravery. I can't pretend to imagine what it must be like to do it on the national stage.** E. Jean Carroll and the millions of sexual assault survivors deserve our respect and support. They deserve our empathy, but never our pity. To all the sexual assault survivors out there, I see you. I believe you. And even if at times it feels all-but impossible to access, know that you're resilient beyond measure. *If you're triggered and need support and/or resources, call the National Sexual Assault Hotline at 1.800.656.HOPE (4673); or go to www.rainn.org. **If you're a survivor, please hear this loud and clear: You are NO less brave if you don't confront your perpetrator. That is a deeply personal decision and sometimes it's the very best, smartest, and most strategic and self-caring decision to never, ever call out your assailant.

After seven protesters were arrested Monday in the Montana legislature following Republican lawmakers' silencing of state Rep. Zooey Zephyr (D-100) over her impassioned defense of transgender and nonbinary children, a group of GOP legislators accused her of ""encouraging an insurrection.""""Peaceful protest is not insurrection."" Although the demonstration was entirely peaceful, the Republicans—members of the Montana Freedom Caucus—blasted what they falsely called ""the violent protesters"" and urged ""immediate disciplinary action"" against Zephyr, who is transgender. ""They want to ring alarm bells and they want to compare this to January 6,"" Andy Nelson, the Democratic Party chair in Missoula County, Montana—which includes Zephyr's district—told the Associated Press. ""There's absolutely no way you can compare what happened on Monday with the January 6 insurrection. Violence occurred that day. No violence occurred in the gallery of the Montana House."" \u201cA violent attack on the Capitol to overturn an election was an insurrection. Peaceful protests by legislators in Tennessee and Montana were not insurrection. Efforts to conflate them are cynical, wrong, and dangerous to democracy.\u201d — Noah Bookbinder (@Noah Bookbinder) 1682627952 It's not just Montana. Republican state lawmakers in Tennessee called it an ""insurrection"" and a ""riot"" when Democratic Reps. Justin Jones (D-52), Justin Pearson, and Gloria Johnson (D-90) took to the well of the legislative chamber to support thousands of Nashville-area students rallying outside for gun control measures following the March 27 Covenant School massacre. Republicans voted to expel Jones and Pearson from the legislature over the protests, though they were swiftly reinstated by municipal councils. Republicans ""are trying to dismiss the integrity and sincerity of what all these people are calling for,"" Tennessee Democratic Rep. John Ray Clemmons (D-55) told the AP. ""They're dismissing what it is just to avoid the debate on this issue."" ""My colleagues across the aisle have spent so much time trying to silence the minority party that anyone speaking up and amplifying their voice probably strikes them as insurrectionist, even though it doesn't resemble anything like it,"" he added. \u201c@bozchron The republicans' misuse of words makes you think they need dictionaries until you realize they are intentionally conflating the definitions of words to further their agendas.\u201d — Bozeman Daily Chronicle (@Bozeman Daily Chronicle) 1682661303 Donald Trump Jr. and other Republicans also described a peaceful February protest at the Oklahoma State Capitol against a ban on gender-affirming healthcare for transgender youth as an ""insurrection."" ""Tennessee. Oklahoma. Montana. The GOP seems to want to redefine the word 'insurrection' to include literally any peaceful protest they don't like,"" tweeted independent journalist and transgender rights activist Erin Reed, who is also Zephyr's partner. ""It's as if they learned a word on January 6th for the first time and never figured out what it meant."" Noah Bookbinder, president of the watchdog Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), asserted that ""peaceful protest is not insurrection,"" and that such conflation ""waters down the seriousness of the real insurrection we saw on Jan. 6, 2021."" Attorney and voting rights activist James Slattery tweeted, ""I can't help but compare the recent Republican efforts to silence legislators in various states who are acting in good faith to advocate for their constituents—while at the national level the Republicans have done nothing to expel members of Congress who incited an insurrection."" \u201cBc if everything is an insurrection, nothing is, not even J6.

841,Trump,2023-04-30,"""Trump's Indictment Won't End 21st Century Fascist Movement He Unleashed""","Donald Trump is the first American president to be indicted. No matter where you see yourself on the political spectrum, that is a very big deal.Although the initial criminal case against Trump is being handled by Manhattan District Attorney Alvin Bragg for what some see as relatively minor business-fraud crimes committed in connection with the payment of hush money to a porn star, it won’t be the last. By late spring or early summer, the ex-president will likely be charged with more consequential offenses in Georgia and in federal court for plotting to overturn the results of the 2020 election; inciting the Jan. 6 insurrection; and absconding to Mar-a-Lago with a trove of top-secret documents. While Trump will be shielded with the presumption of innocence as the wheels of justice turn, the available public evidence suggests he is in serious jeopardy of being convicted of multiple state and federal felonies.Trump also faces liability in two pivotal civil trials in New York. A defamation/rape lawsuit brought by writer E. Jean Carroll is currently underway. In addition, Trump is slated to go on trial in October in a massive fraud case brought by New York Attorney General Letitia James. But even as we anticipate the sweet sound of jury verdicts read in open court, we would do well to reflect on the broader implications of prosecuting Trump for the future of American democracy. There are, on close analysis, both obvious benefits and inherent limitations to what can be achieved through litigation.On the positive side, there can be no question of the need to hold Trump accountable for abusing women, grifting his way to the Oval Office in 2016 and, more critically, for his attempts to cling to power after losing the 2020 campaign by more than 7 million votes. We have all heard the cliché that “no one is above the law,” but prosecuting Trump has given the adage new life and content.There is no good reason to accord Trump, now a private citizen, the kind of legal immunity that the Justice Department unfortunately decided, as a matter of discretionary policy, to afford Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton when they were sitting presidents. Other democracies around the world, including France, Germany and Portugal, have prosecuted their political leaders for corruption with no enduring ill effects. There should be no room for American exceptionalism when it comes to our own leaders.At the same time, we should be under no illusions that taking Trump down will cure all that ails our democracy. Trump is the head of the Republican Party and a political movement that has morphed into a form of 21st-century fascism. Prosecuting Trump, and even sending him to prison, will not extinguish the movement he unleashed.Fascism, as I have written before, is an emotionally loaded and often misused term, but it is as real today — as a political and cultural force, as a set of core beliefs and mode of governance — as it was when Benito Mussolini founded the Italian Fascist Party in 1919 and declared himself dictator six years later. It is on the rise once more across the globe in the Philippines, India, Western Europe, Russia and here at home.Many instructive discussions of fascism can be found in the works of scholars such as Ruth Ben-Ghiat, Timothy Snyder, Jason Stanely and Henry Giroux. Of all the definitions of the term, perhaps the most incisive appears in Robert Paxton’s classic study “The Anatomy of Fascism” (Harvard University Press, 2004). “Fascism,” Paxton writes, may be defined as a form of political behavior marked by obsessive preoccupation with community decline, humiliation or victimhood and by compensatory cults of unity, energy, and purity, in which a mass-based party of committed nationalist militants, working in uneasy but effective collaboration with traditional elites, abandons democratic liberties and pursues with redemptive violence and without ethical or legal restraints goals of internal cleansing and external expansion. After hesitating to call Trump a fascist when he initially took office, Paxton changed his views after Jan. 6. “I resisted for a long time applying the fascist label to Donald J. Trump,” he wrote in Newsweek, “[But] Trump’s incitement of the invasion of the Capitol…removes my objection to the fascist label. His open encouragement of civic violence to overturn an election crosse[d] a red line. The label now seems not just acceptable but necessary.”Giroux offered even more powerful observations in an essay, “Fascist Politics in the Age of Neoliberal Capitalism,” cross-posted earlier this month by CounterPunch and LA Progressive: An upgraded form of fascism with its rabid nativism and hatred of racial mixing is currently at the center of politics in the United States. Traditional liberal values of equality, social justice, dissent and freedom are now considered a threat to a Republican Party supportive of staggering levels of inequality, white Christian nationalism and racial purity. It is by no means clear that the U.S. can withstand the existential threat posed by the upgraded form of fascism we face today. Combating fascism requires a coordinated and concerted political response. To quote Giroux again: Confronting this fascist counter-revolutionary movement necessitates creating a new language and the building of a mass social movement in order to construct empowering terrains of education, politics, justice, culture and power that challenge existing systems of white supremacy, white nationalism, manufactured ignorance and economic oppression. Seen in this light, the effort to bring Donald Trump to justice is the beginning of a much longer struggle, not the end.",Common Dreams,Business,Yes,51.088056116005696,64.74475820111113,98.51139824208671,64.77448919839499,41.14359874250651,73.5989780252741,trump indictment,{},"{'president': 'american', 'spectrum': 'political', 'deal': 'big', 'case': 'massive', 'crimes': 'minor', 'money': 'hush', 'spring': 'late', 'summer': 'early', 'offenses': 'consequential', 'court': 'open', 'documents': 'secret', 'evidence': 'public', 'jeopardy': 'serious', 'felonies': 'multiple', 'trials': 'civil', 'sound': 'sweet', 'implications': 'broader', 'democracy': 'american', 'analysis': 'close', 'benefits': 'obvious', 'limitations': 'inherent', 'side': 'positive', 'life': 'new', 'reason': 'good', 'citizen': 'private', 'immunity': 'legal', 'policy': 'discretionary', 'democracies': 'other', 'leaders': 'own', 'effects': 'ill', 'exceptionalism': 'american', 'time': 'long', 'movement': 'social', 'century': '21st', 'term': 'loaded', 'force': 'political', 'discussions': 'instructive', 'study': 'classic', 'behavior': 'political', 'preoccupation': 'obsessive', 'cults': 'compensatory', 'party': 'based', 'militants': 'nationalist', 'collaboration': 'uneasy', 'elites': 'traditional', 'liberties': 'democratic', 'violence': 'civic', 'restraints': 'ethical', 'cleansing': 'internal', 'expansion': 'external', 'label': 'fascist', 'encouragement': 'open', 'line': 'red', 'observations': 'powerful', 'form': 'upgraded', 'nativism': 'rabid', 'mixing': 'racial', 'values': 'liberal', 'justice': 'social', 'levels': 'staggering', 'nationalism': 'white', 'purity': 'racial', 'threat': 'existential', 'response': 'political', 'necessitates': 'fascist', 'language': 'new', 'systems': 'existing', 'supremacy': 'white', 'oppression': 'economic', 'struggle': 'longer'}",1,1

867,Trump,2023-05-03,"""Fake Content Industry, AI Poses Threat to Fact-Based Journalism Worldwide""","Along with the threats to journalists' safety that watchdog groups have documented for years, the 2023 World Press Freedom Index on Wednesday warned that the rapidly growing artificial intelligence and fake content industries are endangering the livelihoods of journalists around the world and cutting down on people's ability to access fact-based news.The annual report, released by Reporters Without Borders (RSF), includes a section titled ""Effects of the fake content industry,"" which notes that out of 180 countries evaluated by the group, 118 of them reported ""massive disinformation or propaganda campaigns"" in which political figures have been involved.""The unprecedented ability to tamper with content is blurring the lines between true and false,"" RSF said in a video shared on social media as it released the report. \u201c\ud83d\udd34 #RSFIndex | The 21st edition of the World Press Freedom Index, compiled annually by RSF, sheds light on major and often radical changes linked to political, social and technological upheavals. #WPFD2023\u201d — RSF (@RSF) 1683098104 The report points to recent, realistic-looking viral images that were shared widely on social media showing former U.S. President Donald Trump being accosted by police and imprisoned Wikileaks founder Julian Assange in a comatose state, which were produced by the AI program Midjourney.After the Trump photo went viral, journalist and researcher Arthur Holland Michel warned PBS Newshour in March that the technology could just as easily be used to make fake photos or videos, also known as deepfakes, of private citizens for any number of reasons.""From a policy perspective, I'm not sure we're prepared to deal with this scale of disinformation at every level of society,"" Michel wrote in an email. ""My sense is that it's going to take an as-yet-unimagined technical breakthrough to definitively put a stop to this.""Blurred lines between fact and fiction are among the factors that are ""jeopardizing the right to information,"" RSF reported, along with the ""arbitrary, payment-based approach to information"" that Twitter CEO Elon Musk has pushed, charging $8 per month for verified accounts which were once given to users including news outlets that had demonstrated merit. Both developments are turning social media platforms into ""quicksand for journalism,"" said RSF.The report was released two days after NewsGuard published its own analysis, Rise of the Newsbots: AI-Generated News Websites Proliferating Online. That report showed that along with artificial intelligence (AI) companies that create fake images, dozens of websites populated entirely with AI-generated content have begun to ""churn out vast amounts of clickbait articles to optimize advertising revenue.""""In April 2023, NewsGuard identified 49 websites spanning seven languages—Chinese, Czech, English, French, Portuguese, Tagalog, and Thai—that appear to be entirely or mostly generated by artificial intelligence language models designed to mimic human communication—here in the form of what appear to be typical news websites.""The websites publish hundreds of articles per day in some cases, about topics including politics, health, and finance—without ever disclosing their ownership or control or ensuring a human employee reads the information before it's shared with millions of internet users. The lack of human input led at least one of the inauthentic websites analyzed by NewsGuard, CelebrityDeaths.com, to publish a false obituary of U.S. President Joe Biden in April, which stated that Vice President Kamala Harris was acting as president before continuing, ""I'm sorry, I cannot complete this prompt as it goes against OpenAI's use case policy on generating misleading content.""OpenAI is the company behind ChatGPT, currently the fastest-growing app in the world. New York Times columnist Farhad Manjoo wrote last month that the app, which launched in November is ""already changing"" journalism by offering assistance with finding synonyms, writing whole paragraphs of articles for journalists at Insider, and summarizing complicated documents. ""In short, as numerous and more powerful AI tools have been unveiled and made available to the public in recent months, concerns that they could be used to conjure up entire news organizations—once the subject of speculation by media scholars—have now become a reality,"" said NewsGuard.RSF wrote that the challenges posed by AI and fake content—both for journalists and news consumers—are compounding ""volatility"" in the world of journalism, where reporters around the globe are also still in danger of being imprisoned, persecuted, or murdered for their work.Threats to press freedom were classified as ""problematic"" in 68 countries in the last year, ""difficult"" in 38 countries, and ""very serious"" in 20 countries. The safest countries for journalists were found to be Norway—in the top spot for the seventh year running—followed by Ireland and Denmark. Among the worst nations for press freedoms, according to the report: Vietnam, where independent reporters and commentators have been targeted and jailed by the government; China, the world's biggest jailer of journalists and a top source of propaganda and fake content, and North Korea.""The World Press Freedom Index shows enormous volatility in situations, with major rises and falls and unprecedented changes, such as Brazil's 18-place rise and Senegal's 31-place fall,"" said RSF Secretary-General Christiophe Deloire. ""This instability is the result of increased aggressiveness on the part of the authorities in many countries and growing animosity towards journalists on social media and in the physical world.

The members now face a maximum prison sentence of 20 years and numerous potential fines. The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) proved to a jury in Washington, D.C. that former leader Enrique Tarrio was sufficiently involved in the conspiracy to attack the U.S. Capitol as members of Congress certified the 2020 election, even though he was in a hotel room in Baltimore on the day of the insurrection—having been banned from the nation's Capitol the day before by a judge for burning a Black Lives Matter flag stolen from a church. Although Tarrio wasn't present on Capitol Hill as thousands of supporters of Republican then-President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol, encrypted messages revealed during the trial showed that the Proud Boys leader wanted a ""spectacle"" in Washington, D.C. on January 6 and that he said after the attack: ""Make no mistake. We did this.""Prosecutors also publicized a document titled ""1776 Returns"" that they said Tarrio used to map out the planned occupation of Capitol building. The document said the Proud Boys and other far-right, pro-Trump groups including the Oath Keepers would fill federal buildings and at least one news outlet—CNN—""with patriots and communicate our demands.""The document also said the group would maintain control of ""crucial buildings in the D.C. area for a set period of time"" and would try to get as ""many people as possible inside these buildings.""The attack came as Trump and other Republican leaders baselessly claimed that President Joe Biden was not the legitimate winner of the 2020 election, and months after Trump called on the Proud Boys to ""stand back and stand by"" as he repeatedly suggested fraud would be rampant in the voting process.""These Proud Boys just convicted of seditious conspiracy against the United States identified President Donald Trump's admonition for them to 'stand back and stand by' as a major motivation for recruitment and action,"" said Todd Zwillich, deputy Washington, D.C. bureau chief for Vice News. \u201cThe obvious bottom line gets lost: The President of the United States spurred on multiple extremist groups to undertake sedition against the country.

1001,Trump,2023-05-14,"""Beware: Ron DeSantis' Attack on Voting Rights Won't Stay in Florida""","In an increasingly unsafe and, frankly, unhinged America, one of the things that keeps me up at night is the question of whether Governor Ron DeSantis’s far-right Florida will ultimately serve as a model for a national Republican Party in charge of the entire federal government. (Legislative and executive branches aside, of course no political party is technically supposed to control the ostensibly nonpartisan judicial branch. But we all know how that’s going.)The competition is stiff this year, with Idaho, Tennessee, and more recently (and somewhat surprisingly) Montana all making strong bids for the title. But how can anyone compete with a state governed by a man so rabidly “anti-woke” that he has declared war on Mickey Mouse, a major source of tourism dollars?I think it’s safe to say no state has surpassed Florida in the practical implementation of authoritarian governance, which DeSantis has pulled off with the help of both a rubber-stamp GOP supermajority in the state legislature and a peculiar knack for stacking the bureaucracy with right-wing Christian ideologues who have no qualms about imposing their hyper-partisan will in areas like healthcare and education.In his “war on woke,” DeSantis has shattered pre-existing norms, brazenly politicizing the Florida Board of Medicine as he attacked transgender Floridians and appointing Christopher Rufo – the right-wing activist who started the “critical race theory” panic – to the board of trustees of New College of Florida, a sometime quirky state liberal arts college known as a haven for queer Florida youth that is now being transformed into an ideologically driven indoctrination center.No state has surpassed Florida in the practical implementation of authoritarian governance, which DeSantis has pulled off with the help of both a rubber-stamp GOP supermajority in the state legislature and a peculiar knack for stacking the bureaucracy with right-wing Christian ideologuesJust last week, Florida passed two new authoritarian laws. One is a bathroom bill affecting schools, government buildings, prisons, and detention centers that imposes criminal “trespassing” charges on those who use a bathroom that does not correspond to their sex according to “chromosomes, naturally occurring sex hormones, and internal and external genitalia present at birth”. The other is a medical “conscience” bill that began as a way to protect healthcare practitioners opposed to public health mandates set during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, but that will also allow providers to refuse to provide treatment based on their personal beliefs, i.e. to discriminate against queer and especially trans people. And on top of that, for good measure, the Florida state senate passed a downright asinine resolution urging the United States Congress to stop the military from pursuing diversity initiatives and being too “woke” in matters of personnel.DeSantis touts his approach to Florida as a “blueprint” for remaking the United States, and there is no doubt the Republican base adores his penchant for political theatre and misusing government to “own the libs” and punish the marginalized.But more sophisticated Republicans – including key members of the all-important donor class – have begun to hesitate about backing DeSantis, worried (correctly) that his hard right social policies are alienating to independent voters, who trended Democrat in 2022 over abortion, leading to the underperforming of Republican candidates relative to historical tendencies. Some also accuse DeSantis of a lack of “people skills,” failing to return phone calls to donors and state legislators, and there is clearly a severe charisma gap between DeSantis and Donald Trump.Of course, DeSantis – still officially undeclared for the 2024 primaries but also Trump’s only serious competition for the Republican Party’s nomination for the presidency – need not be elected for a Republican president and Republican-controlled congress to try and implement much of what he has done in Florida. And one of his policies is particularly worrisome in that regard: his mobilization of an ‘Office of Election Crimes and Security’ – essentially a brand new sort of election police – to terrorize individuals whose votes were retroactively deemed illegal.As I’ve belaboured before, America’s political system is broken in ways that favour Republicans, who have also shown in recent years they will always choose power over democracy. Republicans have often been able to win the presidency while losing the popular vote for president in recent election cycles, because, through a system known as the Electoral College, the American system counts states’ ‘votes’ for president rather than individuals’, meaning that in most states, the votes of those in the minority end up having no impact on the presidential race. Where Republicans control state governments, they also engage in voter suppression and gerrymandering in order to give themselves unfair advantages. Republicans also regularly push a false narrative that America is wracked with widespread “voter fraud,” and it was this narrative that fueled the 6 January insurrection, which was centred on the bald-faced lie that then president-elect Joe Biden had somehow “stolen” the election from Trump.Oddly enough, the 2018 Florida gubernatorial election in which DeSantis beat Democratic challenger Andrew Gillum was affected by voter suppression, but it also saw the passage of a state constitutional amendment widely touted as a win for democracy: the re-enfranchisement of convicted felons who have completed their sentences, including parole or probation. Previously, Florida banned all convicted felons from voting. After 2018, those restrictions were lifted except for those convicted of murder or sexual crimes. And this is where things get messy.Between their founding in April 2022 and January 2023, DeSantis’s election police made a total of 24 arrests of people who had voted illegally, but almost certainly without the intent to do so, in the 2020 election – an election in which over 11 million Floridians voted. In at least some cases these rehabilitated felons were issued voter cards by the state, which is an obvious indication that they voted in good faith, and that, if anyone is liable for the error, it should be the Florida state government. Nevertheless, out of the blue, DeSantis sent in his shiny new force to disrupt and destroy the lives they had rebuilt. Despite the fact that these election police clearly have almost nothing to do, DeSantis and the state legislature have moved to increase their budget.Some of these arrests led to plea deals that resulted in no jail time, while six have been dismissed by the courts, according to reporting by Lori Rosza for The Washington Post. DeSantis and his supporters presumably want convictions, since gratuitous cruelty is a hallmark of fascist politics – and indeed, the state legislature has obligingly moved to give the statewide prosecutor jurisdiction over ‘voter fraud’ cases in order to stop courts from dismissing cases on jurisdictional grounds, as several have done to date. But the arrests need not result in convictions for the possibility of being arrested for voting to have a deterrent effect among e.g. African-American communities – precisely the kinds of communities whose voting Republicans seek to suppress.Rosza’s reporting covers the case of Peter Washington, who was issued a voter ID card before he went to cast his vote for Biden. Per Rosza’s description, Washington “knows now he can’t vote – unless he applies for and receives clemency – but he’s telling others they should be wary of it, too, even if they don’t have a criminal record. One of his adult children has already decided he won’t be casting a ballot. A friend is doubting it, too.”Thinking nationally again, with respect to 2024 and beyond, the possibility that a future Republican president might create a national voting police force is terrifying. The fiction of a ‘voter fraud’ crisis Republicans already use to mobilise voters and stir up fear and outrage is plenty damaging; 6 January amply illustrates that point. But imagine the creation of federal machinery to enforce that phoney narrative through state terror, and the impact that would have on voting throughout the United States. It may seem far-fetched, but DeSantis is already engaging in state terror in Florida. And if Republicans had to worry less about their base’s preferred culture wars policies alienating voters, the donor class would have little incentive to shy away from culture warriors like DeSantis. And that’s what really keeps me up at night.",Common Dreams,Business,Yes,54.270998726456256,99.06251382417406,85.29321334037154,93.80549005395324,66.8184638217744,80.3025046733013,ron desantis,{},"{'government': 'federal', 'branches': 'legislative', 'party': 'political', 'branch': 'judicial', 'bids': 'strong', 'source': 'major', 'implementation': 'practical', 'governance': 'authoritarian', 'knack': 'peculiar', 'wing': 'right', 'ideologues': 'christian', 'will': 'partisan', 'norms': 'existing', 'activist': 'wing', 'theory': 'critical', 'college': 'quirky', 'arts': 'liberal', 'youth': 'queer', 'center': 'driven', 'week': 'last', 'laws': 'authoritarian', 'charges': 'criminal', 'genitalia': 'internal', 'bill': 'medical', 'health': 'public', 'beliefs': 'personal', 'measure': 'good', 'resolution': 'asinine', 'base': 'republican', 'theatre': 'political', 'members': 'key', 'class': 'important', 'policies': 'social', 'voters': 'independent', 'candidates': 'relative', 'tendencies': 'historical', 'gap': 'severe', 'competition': 'serious', 'president': 'republican', 'sort': 'new', 'system': 'american', 'years': 'recent', 'vote': 'popular', 'cycles': 'recent', 'states': 'most', 'race': 'presidential', 'advantages': 'unfair', 'narrative': 'false', 'fraud': 'widespread', 'lie': 'faced', 'election': 'gubernatorial', 'challenger': 'democratic', 'amendment': 'constitutional', 'felons': 'rehabilitated', 'crimes': 'sexual', 'indication': 'obvious', 'faith': 'good', 'force': 'national', 'cruelty': 'gratuitous', 'politics': 'fascist', 'jurisdiction': 'statewide', 'grounds': 'jurisdictional', 'communities': 'american', 'record': 'criminal', 'machinery': 'federal', 'wars': 'preferred', 'incentive': 'little'}",1,1

1055,Trump,2023-05-22,"""Stand Up America Statement on Senator Tim Scott's Presidential Announcement""","Today, U.S. Senator Tim Scott (R-S.C.) announced he will run for president in 2024. Scott enters the Republican primary against indicted former president Donald Trump and former South Carolina Governor Nikki Haley. The candidates will reportedly be joined by fellow MAGA extremist and Trump understudy Ron DeSantis, who is expected to announce his candidacy in the coming days. Stand Up America’s spokesperson, Sarah Harris, issued the following statement:“Tim Scott has tried to cultivate the image of a Republican who stays above the MAGA fray, but his voting record says otherwise. From championing tax giveaways to the richest Americans and corporations to opposing federal legislation to protect voting rights, Scott has built his career voting against the interests of everyday Americans in South Carolina and across the country. “As we look ahead to the 2024 election, it’s critical that voters understand that the current roster of GOP candidates for president––Trump, Haley, DeSantis, and Scott––are all MAGA extremists who are a threat to our democracy and our freedoms. We must do everything in our power to ensure they are not sent to the Oval Office in 2025.”Scott has long been a champion for right-wing causes. As Senator, Scott has voted in lockstep with the MAGA agenda – opposing key legislation like the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act for gun safety legislation. Scott has also been a vocal supporter of tax cuts for billionaires and federal limits on reproductive justice. Despite his “moderate” persona, he remains a strong ally of Donald Trump and continues to perpetuate MAGA misinformation and vote against the interests of the American people. Stand Up America was founded in 2016 as a digital-first grassroots community working to resist Donald Trump and his cronies’ corruption, racism, and his threats to our democracy. From 2017 to 2021, our members made 1.7 million calls to Congress to oppose the MAGA extremist agenda. In 2020, our volunteers contacted 25 million voters to help defeat Trump and elect Joe Biden to the presidency. During the 2022 midterms, our team helped build a firewall for democracy ahead of 2024 by electing pro-democracy Secretaries of State in Arizona, Michigan, Minnesota, and Nevada, passing key democracy ballot initiatives, and mobilizing our members to get out the vote for progressive candidates nationwide. In 2024, our community will continue mobilizing to elect candidates who will stand up for our freedoms and our democracy.",Common Dreams,Business,Yes,54.50403651516383,77.40808914053969,91.64105060709286,95.93098242731072,56.943761277161514,58.723430733386564,america statement,{},"{'primary': 'republican', 'president': 'former', 'extremist': 'fellow', 'days': 'coming', 'legislation': 'key', 'roster': 'current', 'wing': 'right', 'causes': 'wing', 'supporter': 'vocal', 'limits': 'federal', 'justice': 'reproductive', 'persona': 'moderate', 'ally': 'strong', 'people': 'american', 'community': 'grassroots', 'agenda': 'extremist', 'initiatives': 'key', 'candidates': 'progressive'}",0,0

It was looked at as a natural successor—if you will—to other sublime shows of the last two-plus decades (The Sopranos, The Wire, and Breaking Bad, among others).Like other great shows, Succession eclipses the realm of a regular drama, where a focus on action-based plots take a backseat to epic dialogue, emotional turmoil, and the sad absurdity of the human condition. It’s more of a Greek tragedy or a Shakespeare play than its drama contemporaries, camouflaged by the struggle for a successor in a media empire. For every classic plot twist or suspenseful moment you might see in a show like Lost or M*A*S*H*, there are 10 several-minute monologues that use words like “corpuscles” and “geysers.”A commonality in all of these shows is also elite writing. We root for murderous hit men, DEA agents and Donald Trump Jr.-inspired nepo babies, not because we like them but because good writing makes us feel things and sympathize with these characters on a flawed, human level.

The company says it “carefully deliberated this change” without offering any specifics on its reasons for the about-face. YouTube initially banned content disputing the results of the 2020 election in December of that year.In a feeble attempt to explain its decision (first reported byAxios), YouTube wrote that it “recognized it was time to reevaluate the effects of this policy in today's changed landscape. In the current environment, we find that while removing this content does curb some misinformation, it could also have the unintended effect of curtailing political speech without meaningfully reducing the risk of violence or other real-world harm. With that in mind, and with 2024 campaigns well underway, we will stop removing content that advances false claims that widespread fraud, errors, or glitches occurred in the 2020 and other past US Presidential elections.”Misinformation and disinformation are harmful on a societal level. They lure people into a false-reality bubble of “alternative facts” where the despots are the “good guys” and those supporting democracy are corrupt or untrustworthy. Failing that, it can leave people too confused to know what is and isn’t real; that type of gaslighting is nearly as beneficial to authoritarian movements as drawing in rabid supporters.The change comes as 2024 Republican front-runner Donald Trump and others continue to spread false claims about the results of the 2020 election. In addition to misleading voters, bogus statements about election integrity can also lead to the adoption of laws making it harder for people to vote: essentially voter-suppression legislation passed under the guise of “election security.”If YouTube found some data that somehow reveals the dissemination of election denialism isn’t harmful after all, it would seem appropriate for the company to reveal that. But short of that, all we have is YouTube’s claim that it “carefully deliberated” this move.This article originally appeared on Engadget at https://www.engadget.com/youtube-changes-misinformation-policy-to-allow-videos-falsely-claiming-fraud-in-the-2020-us-election-184319851.html?src=rss",Engadget,Technology,Yes,52.76314056918716,99.96598135329825,99.99930826501657,80.052608896117,71.41495726172622,43.639546390344464,youtube misinformation,{},"{'content': 'banned', 'attempt': 'feeble', 'byaxios': 'reported', 'landscape': 'changed', 'environment': 'current', 'effect': 'unintended', 'speech': 'political', 'harm': 'other', 'world': 'real', 'claims': 'false', 'fraud': 'widespread', 'elections': 'presidential', 'level': 'societal', 'reality': 'false', 'facts': 'alternative', 'guys': 'good', 'movements': 'authoritarian', 'supporters': 'rabid', 'runner': 'front', 'statements': 'bogus'}",0,1

Col. Birchum’s home in Tampa, Florida, just as FBI agents later searched Trump’s residence in Palm Beach. The object of both searches was the same: to find unlawfully retained classified documents.Investigators found a thumb drive and numerous classified documents stashed in Birchum’s house and in a storage pod parked in his driveway, just as the FBI would find numerous classified documents in a storage room at Mar-a-Lago. They also found a hard drive containing classified files in Birchum’s quarters in Afghanistan, where he was on his sixth and final combat deployment despite having been diagnosed with PTSD that required hospitalizations.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,Yes,51.7574776478894,24.818588084268477,99.84003032184523,70.8801528698157,70.09731134716469,72.9028763880035,case donald,{},"{'documents': 'classified', 'crime': 'same', 'officer': 'decorated', 'forces': 'special', 'disability': 'psychiatric', 'drive': 'hard', 'files': 'classified', 'deployment': 'sixth', 'hospitalizations': 'required'}",0,1

The case against Trump looks strong based on the indictment’s compelling detail of Trump’s alleged mishandling of national defense documents and efforts to obstruct justice. Evidence referenced in the charging documents include text messages from Trump’s co-defendant and personal valet, Walt Nauta, audio of Trump himself seemingly admitting he knew he could not de-classify documents once he left the Presidency, as well the notes of Trump’s own lawyer with all of it woven into a narrative that seeks to explain to the court and American public why the case is not about mere sloppy document management. Thus far the defenses put forth by Trump and his legal team fail to impress.The legal defenses—I’m not counting Trump’s various insults directed at Special Counsel Jack Smith as legal defenses—thus far appear to fall into two buckets: prosecutorial misconduct and supposed de-classification of documents. The prosecutorial misconduct may be based upon reports that prosecutor Jay Bratt, Chief of the DOJ’s Counterintelligence section, may have engaged in conversation with Nauta’s defense lawyer, Stanley Woodward, that included bringing up Woodward’s application to become a judge.

Ron DeSantis is your bartender, don’t try to order a Bud Light.  The 2024 presidential candidate jumped behind the bar for patrons at The Bunker at the Veterans of Foreign Wars Post in Sparks, Nevada during a campaign stop on Friday but refused to serve one particular drink: Bud Light. The beer brand faced backlash and a conservative boycott after its partnership with Dylan Mulvaney, a transgender activist. It’s since become a flashpoint in the right-wing’s ever-growing anti-LGBTQ movement. “Just so you know, I'll serve you anything except Bud Light. I just can't do that,” DeSantis said.  A spokesperson for DeSantis posted a clip of the interaction on Saturday. https://twitter.com/lindseycurnutte/status/1670083879607373825/ In an April interview with conservative commentator Benny Johnson, DeSantis said he would no longer drink Bud Light anymore because he didn’t want to support “woke companies” and their goals of ""trying to change our country, trying to change policy, [and] trying to change [the] culture."" ""Why would you want to drink Bud Light? I mean like honestly, that’s like them rubbing our faces in it, and it’s like these companies that do this, if they never have any response, they are just gonna keep doing it,"" DeSantis said. But while DeSantis might not be kicking back with a bottle of Bud Light any time soon, he hasn’t moved to penalize Anheuser-Busch—which employs about 800 in the state—in any notable way, according to a report by HuffPost. Anheuser-Busch operates both a brewery and a can factory in Jacksonville, and in 2015—pre-DeSantis’ governorship—Anheuser-Busch chose its Jacksonville can factory over two competing cities to increase its production of aluminum bottles. Over a two-year period, the company invested $170 million and created 75 new jobs to expand its factory to produce aluminum bottles. In doing so, it received $3 million in grants from Florida on top of $12 million in grants and other incentives from Jacksonville, according to HuffPost. And while DeSantis and others may say the beer maker has gone “woke”—the money paints a different picture.  Last election cycle, nearly $400,000 (or 62%) of Anheuser-Busch’s contributions at a federal level went to Republicans, according to the nonpartisan watchdog site OpenSecrets. That figure doesn’t include state-level giving, such as the $47,080 the company has given the Republican Party of Florida since the beginning of this year. Anheuser-Busch also gave the state party about $80,000 during the 2022 cycle, $50,000 of which came in August amid DeSantis’ reelection bid. The company also dropped a $50,000 contribution to DeSantis’ committee in February 2021, according to state campaign finance records. Some prominent conservatives, including Donald Trump Jr., opposed the boycott because of the company’s long history of contributing to Republican causes. But many DeSantis supporters have pointed to the Floridian’s pro-boycott stance as evidence that he’d make a better president than Donald Trump (the former president himself largely remained silent on the issue, before eventually remarking in May that the boycott is proof ""money does talk”). “Ron DeSantis will talk s*** about Bud Light for what they've done and Disney because he don't care about the donations and the money,” one user tweeted. “But Donald Trump will coward down to these companies because of the money.” https://twitter.com/AntStith/status/1670772986058514438 “What's impressive about DeSantis is he will not let donor demands sway him,” wrote another user on Sunday. https://twitter.com/patmcguinness/status/1670639728230580224 DeSantis’ press secretary linked to an article about Trump Jr.'s opposition to the boycott with a simple clown emoji response on Saturday, as the video of DeSantis gained traction. https://twitter.com/JeremyRedfernFL/status/1670086043578630144 The Daily Dot has reached out to DeSantis’ campaign for comment.

It was said that you would destroy the Sith, not join them,"" Obi-Wan DeSantis says, implying that Trump had lost his way as an America first hardline Republican. In recent months, as his presidential campaign ramped up, DeSantis has attacked Trump from the right, criticizing him on everything from immigration to his COVID-19 policies. It concludes with Trump screaming ""I hate you."" That's all well and good in the vacuum of the 22-second video, but nothing online lives without context (and obsessive fandoms), which meant people were swift to note what would happen if you extrapolated further. After leaving Trump for dead (defeating him in a CPAC straw poll or something), instead of ascending to power (the presidency), DeSantis would actually flee to the galaxy's largest cesspool of scum and villainy, home to its worst bars (gonna assume Panama City) and hide as a wrecked shell of his former while Trump ascended to absolute power and murdered him (defeated him in the 2024 primary). To go even further (why not?), right before dying, DeSantis would dedicate himself to teaching the art of MAGA to Trump's son (Barron or Don Jr., dealer's choice), who would then become the most powerful being in the country (president in Don Jr.'s case, or the world's tallest TikTok influencer in Barron's).

1791,Trump,2023-06-28,"""How Often Do Health Insurers Say No to Patients? No One Knows.""","by Robin Fields ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up to receive our biggest stories as soon as they’re published. It’s one of the most crucial questions people have when deciding which health plan to choose: If my doctor orders a test or treatment, will my insurer refuse to pay for it? After all, an insurance company that routinely rejects recommended care could damage both your health and your finances. The question becomes ever more pressing as many working Americans see their premiums rise as their benefits shrink. Yet, how often insurance companies say no is a closely held secret. There’s nowhere that a consumer or an employer can go to look up all insurers’ denial rates — let alone whether a particular company is likely to decline to pay for procedures or drugs that its plans appear to cover. The lack of transparency is especially galling because state and federal regulators have the power to fix it, but haven’t. ProPublica, in collaboration with The Capitol Forum, has been examining the hidden world of insurance denials. A previous story detailed how one of the nation’s largest insurers flagged expensive claims for special scrutiny; a second story showed how a different top insurer used a computer program to bulk-deny claims for some common procedures with little or no review. The findings revealed how little consumers know about the way their claims are reviewed — and denied — by the insurers they pay to cover their medical costs. When ProPublica set out to find information on insurers’ denial rates, we hit a confounding series of roadblocks. In 2010, federal regulators were granted expansive authority through the Affordable Care Act to require that insurers provide information on their denials. This data could have meant a sea change in transparency for consumers. But more than a decade later, the federal government has collected only a fraction of what it’s entitled to. And what information it has released, experts say, is so crude, inconsistent and confusing that it’s essentially meaningless. The national group for state insurance commissioners gathers a more detailed, reliable trove of information. Yet, even though commissioners’ primary duty is to protect consumers, they withhold nearly all of these details from the public. ProPublica requested the data from every state’s insurance department, but none provided it. Two states collect their own information on denials and make it public, but their data covers only a tiny subset of health plans serving a small number of people. The minuscule amount of details available about denials robs consumers of a vital tool for comparing health plans. “This is life and death for people: If your insurance won’t cover the care you need, you could die,” said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at KFF (formerly known as the Kaiser Family Foundation) who has written repeatedly about the issue. “It’s all knowable. It’s known to the insurers, but it is not known to us.” The main trade groups for health insurance companies, AHIP (formerly known as America’s Health Insurance Plans) and the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, say the industry supports transparency and complies with government disclosure requirements. Yet the groups have often argued against expanding this reporting, saying the burdens it would impose on insurance companies would outweigh the benefits for consumers. “Denial rates are not directly comparable from one health plan to another and could lead consumers to make inaccurate conclusions on the robustness of the health plan,” Kelly Parsons, director of media relations for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, said in an email. The trade groups stress that a substantial majority of patient claims are approved and that there can be good reasons — including errors and incomplete information from doctors — for some to be denied. “More abstract data about percentages of claims that are approved or denied have no context and are not a reliable indicator of quality — it doesn’t address why a claim was or was not approved, what happened after the claim was not approved the first time, or how a patient or their doctor can help ensure a claim will be approved,” AHIP spokesperson Kristine Grow said in a written response to questions from ProPublica. “Americans deserve information and data that has relevance to their own personal health and circumstances.” The limited government data available suggests that, overall, insurers deny between 10% and 20% of the claims they receive. Aggregate numbers, however, shed no light on how denial rates may vary from plan to plan or across types of medical services. Some advocates say insurers have a good reason to dodge transparency. Refusing payment for medical care and drugs has become a staple of their business model, in part because they know customers appeal less than 1% of denials, said Wendell Potter, who oversaw Cigna’s communications team for more than a decade before leaving the industry in 2008 to become a consumer advocate. “That’s money left on the table that the insurers keep,” he said. At least one insurer disputes this. Potter’s former employer, Cigna, said in an email that his “unsubstantiated opinions” don’t reflect the company’s business model. In a separate written statement, Cigna said it passes on the money it saves “by lowering the cost of health care services and reducing wasteful spending” to the employers who hire it to administer their plans or insure their workers. The few morsels insurers have served up on denials stand in stark contrast to the avalanche of information they’ve divulged in recent years on other fronts, often in response to government mandates. Starting last year, for example, insurers began disclosing the prices they’ve negotiated to pay medical providers for most services. Experts say it’ll take similar mandates to make insurers cough up information on denials, in part because they fear plans with low denial rates would be a magnet for people who are already ailing. “Health plans would never do that voluntarily, would give you what their claim denial rates are, because they don’t want to attract sicker people,” said Mila Kofman, who leads the District of Columbia’s Affordable Care Act exchange and previously served as Maine’s superintendent of insurance. About 85% of people with insurance who responded to a recent KFF survey said they want regulators to compel insurers to disclose how often they deny claims. Pollitz, who co-authored a report on the survey, is a cancer survivor who vividly recalls her own experiences with insurance denials. “Sometimes it would just make me cry when insurance would deny a claim,” she said. “It was like, ‘I can’t deal with this now, I’m throwing up, I just can’t deal with this.’” Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at KFF, has written repeatedly about the lack of data on how often insurance companies deny claims. (Alyssa Schukar, special to ProPublica) She should have been able to learn how her plan handled claims for cancer treatment compared with other insurers, she said. “There could be much more accountability.” In September 2009, amid a roiling national debate over health care, the California Nurses Association made a startling announcement: Three of the state’s six largest health insurers had each denied 30% or more of the claims submitted to them in the first half of the year. California insurers instantly said the figures were misleading, inflated by claims submitted in error or for patients ineligible for coverage. But beyond the unexpectedly high numbers, the real surprise was that the nurses association was able to figure out the plans’ denial rates at all, by using information researchers found on the California Department of Managed Health Care’s website. At the time, no other state or federal regulatory agency was collecting or publishing details about how often private insurers denied claims, a 2009 report by the Center for American Progress found. The Affordable Care Act, passed the following year, was a game changer when it came to policing insurers and pushing them to be more transparent. The law took aim at insurers’ practice of excluding people with preexisting conditions, the most flagrant type of denial, and required companies offering plans on the marketplaces created under the law to disclose their prices and detail their benefits. A less-noticed section of the law demanded transparency from a much broader group of insurers about how many claims they turned down, and it put the Department of Health and Human Services in charge of making this information public. The disclosure requirements applied not only to health plans sold on the new marketplaces but also to the employer plans that cover most Americans. The law’s proponents in the Obama administration said they envisioned a flow of accurate, timely information that would empower consumers and help regulators spot problematic insurers or practices. That’s not what happened. The federal government didn’t start publishing data until 2017 and thus far has only demanded numbers for plans on the federal marketplace known as Healthcare.gov. About 12 million people get coverage from such plans — less than 10% of those with private insurance. Federal regulators say they eventually intend to compel health plans outside the Obamacare exchanges to release details about denials, but so far have made no move to do so. Within the limited universe of Healthcare.gov, KFF’s analyses show that insurers, on average, deny almost 1 in 5 claims and that each year some reject more than 1 in 3. But there are red flags that suggest insurers may not be reporting their figures consistently. Companies’ denial rates vary more than would be expected, ranging from as low as 2% to as high as almost 50%. Plans’ denial rates often fluctuate dramatically from year to year. A gold-level plan from Oscar Insurance Company of Florida rejected 66% of payment requests in 2020, then turned down just 7% in 2021. That insurer’s parent company, Oscar Health, was co-founded by Joshua Kushner, the younger brother of former President Donald Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner. An Oscar Health spokesperson said in an email that the 2020 results weren’t a fair reflection of the company’s business “for a variety of reasons,” but wouldn’t say why. “We closely monitor our overall denial rates and they have remained comfortably below 20% over the last few years, including the 2020-2021 time period,” the spokesperson wrote. Experts say they can’t tell if insurers with higher denial rates are counting differently or are genuinely more likely to leave customers without care or stuck with big bills. “It’s not standardized, it’s not audited, it’s not really meaningful,” Peter Lee, the founding executive director of California’s state marketplace, said of the federal government’s information. Data, he added, “should be actionable. This is not by any means right now.” Officials at the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, which collects the denial numbers for the federal government, say they’re doing more to validate them and improve their quality. It’s notable, though, that the agency doesn’t use this data to scrutinize or take action against outliers. “They’re not using it for anything,” Pollitz said. Pollitz has co-authored four reports that call out the data’s shortcomings. An upshot of all of them: Much of what consumers would most want to know is missing. The federal government provides numbers on insurers’ denials of claims for services from what the industry calls “in-network” medical providers, those who have contracts with the insurer. But it doesn’t include claims for care outside those networks. Patients often shoulder more costs for out-of-network services, ramping up the import of these denials. In recent years, doctors and patients have complained bitterly that insurers are requiring them to get approval in advance for an increasing array of services, causing delays and, in some instances, harm. The government, however, hasn’t compelled insurers to reveal how many requests for prior authorization they get or what percent they deny. These and other specifics — particularly about which procedures and treatments insurers reject most — would be necessary to turn the government’s data into a viable tool to help consumers choose health plans, said Eric Ellsworth, the director of health data strategy at Consumers' Checkbook, which designs such tools. A spokesperson for CMS said that, starting in plan year 2024, the agency will require insurers offering federal marketplace plans to submit a few more numbers, including on out-of-network claims, but there’s no timeline yet for much of what advocates say is necessary. Another effort, launched by a different set of federal regulators, illustrates the resistance that government officials encounter when they consider demanding more. The U.S. Department of Labor regulates upwards of 2 million health plans, including many in which employers pay directly for workers’ health care coverage rather than buying it from insurance companies. Roughly two-thirds of American workers with insurance depend on such plans, according to KFF. In July 2016, an arm of the Labor Department proposed rules requiring these plans to reveal a laundry list of never-before-disclosed information, including how many claims they turned down. In addition, the agency said it was considering whether to demand the dollar amount of what the denied care cost, as well as a breakdown of the reasons why plans turned down claims or denied behavioral health services. The disclosures were necessary to “remedy the current failure to collect data about a large sector of the health plan market,” as well as to satisfy mandates in the Affordable Care Act and provide critical information for agency oversight, a Labor Department factsheet said. Trade groups for employers, including retailers and the construction industry, immediately pushed back. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce said complying with the proposal would take an amount of work not justified by “the limited gains in transparency and enforcement ability.” The powerful business group made it sound like having to make the disclosures could spark insurance Armageddon: Employers might cut back benefits or “eliminate health and welfare benefits altogether.” Trade groups for health insurance companies, which often act as administrators for employers that pay directly for workers’ health care, joined with business groups to blast the proposal. The Blue Cross Blue Shield Association called the mandated disclosures “burdensome and expensive.” AHIP questioned whether the Labor Department had the legal authority to collect the data and urged the agency to withdraw the idea “in its entirety.” The proposal also drew opposition from another, less expected quarter: unions. Under some collective bargaining agreements, unions co-sponsor members’ health plans and would have been on the hook for the new reporting requirements, too. The AFL-CIO argued the requirements created a higher standard of disclosure for plans overseen by the Labor Department. To be fair and avoid confusion, the group said, the Labor Department should put its rules on ice until federal health regulators adopted equivalent ones for plans this proposal didn’t cover. That left the transparency push without political champions on the left or the right, former Assistant Secretary of Labor Phyllis Borzi, who ran the part of the agency that tried to compel more disclosure, said in a recent interview. “When you’re up against a united front from the industry, the business community and labor, it’s really hard to make a difference,” she said. By the time the Labor Department stopped accepting feedback, Donald Trump had been elected president. One trade association for large employers pointed out that the Affordable Care Act, which partly drove the new rules, was “a law that the incoming Administration and the incoming leadership of the 115th Congress have vowed to repeal, delay, dismantle, and otherwise not enforce.” The law managed to survive the Trump administration, but the Labor Department’s transparency push didn’t. The agency withdrew its proposal in September 2019. A Labor Department spokesperson said the Biden administration has no immediate plan to revive it. Ultimately, it’s the National Association of Insurance Commissioners, a group for the top elected or appointed state insurance regulators, that has assembled the most robust details about insurance denials. The association’s data encompasses more plans than the federal information, is more consistent and captures more specifics, including numbers of out-of-network denials, information about prior authorizations and denial rates for pharmacy claims. All states except New York and North Dakota participate. Yet, consumers get almost no access. The commissioners’ association only publishes national aggregate statistics, keeping the rest of its cache secret. When ProPublica requested the detailed data from each state’s insurance department, none would hand it over. More than 30 states said insurers had submitted the information under the authority commissioners are granted to examine insurers’ conduct. And under their states’ codes, they said, examination materials must be kept confidential. The commissioners association said state insurance regulators use the information to compare companies, flag outliers and track trends. Birny Birnbaum, a longtime insurance watchdog who serves on the group’s panel of consumer representatives, said the association’s approach reflects how state insurance regulators have been captured by the insurance industry’s demands for secrecy. “Many seem to view their roles as protectors of industry information, as opposed to enforcers of public information laws,” Birnbaum said in an email. Connecticut and Vermont compile their own figures and make them publicly accessible. Connecticut began reporting information on denials first, adding these numbers to its annual insurer report card in 2011. Vermont demands more details, requiring insurers that cover more than 2,000 Vermonters to publicly release prior authorization and prescription drug information that is similar to what the state insurance commissioners collect. Perhaps most usefully, insurers have to separate claims denied because of administrative problems — many of which will be resubmitted and paid — from denials that have “member impact.” These involve services rejected on medical grounds or because they are contractually excluded. Mike Fisher, Vermont’s state health care advocate, said there’s little indication consumers or employers are using the state’s information, but he still thinks the prospect of public scrutiny may have affected insurers’ practices. The most recent data shows Vermont plans had denial rates between 7.7% and 10.26%, considerably lower than the average for plans on Healthcare.gov. “I suspect that’s not a coincidence,” Fisher said. “Shining a light on things helps.” Despite persistent complaints from insurers that Vermont’s requirements are time-consuming and expensive, no insurers have left the state over it. “Certainly not,” said Sebastian Arduengo, who oversees the reporting for the Vermont Department of Financial Regulation. In California, once considered the most transparent state, the Department of Managed Health Care in 2011 stopped requiring insurance carriers to specify how many claims they rejected. A department spokesperson said in an email that the agency follows the requirements in state law, and the law doesn’t require health plans to disclose denials. The state posts reports that flag some plans for failing to pay claims fairly and on time. Consumers can use those to calculate bare-bones denial rates for some insurers, but for others, you’d have to file a public records request to get the details needed to do the math. Despite the struggles of the last 15 years, Pollitz hasn’t given up hope that one day there will be enough public information to rank insurers by their denial rates and compare how reliably they provide different services, from behavioral health to emergency care. “There’s a name and shame function that is possible here,” she said. “It holds some real potential for getting plans to clean up their acts.” Kirsten Berg contributed research.

Jean Carroll, reversing a controversial decision to defend the former President in 2021. In reaction to the decision, Nicole Regalado, Vice President of Campaigns at UltraViolet, a leading national gender-justice organization, issued the following statement: “The Justice Department made the right choice by reversing its earlier decision to shield Donald Trump from E. Jean Carroll’s defamation lawsuit. Defending a convicted sexual abuser was a waste of the Justice Department’s precious time, money, and resources.“After becoming President in 2016, Donald Trump used the Department of Justice as his own law firm – hiding behind federal protections and shielding himself from accountability under criminal law. Trump deserves to face the consequences of his actions in Court without hiding behind federal government attorneys.“Slandering survivors of sexual abuse should never be considered a legitimate function of federal office holders. That’s why the Justice Department’s decision to reverse course and stop defending Trump is a victory E. Jean Carroll and all survivors who seek legal redress against their abusers.”In 2021, members of UltraViolet criticized Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Department of Justice for shielding Trump from Carroll’s defamation lawsuit. The group also sent a joint letter to President Biden denouncing and launched a petition urging the Department of Justice not to defend Trump, which garnered over 30,000 signatures.VIEW THE PETITION HERE: https://act.weareultraviolet.org/sign/DOJ_Trump/UltraViolet has expressed its unwavering support for E.

Are We Ready?""","Illustration by Elizabeth Brockway/The Daily BeastIt’s now widely accepted that former President Donald Trump is likely to be the Republican presidential nominee in 2024. With Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis sliding back in the latest polls, Trump has little competition remaining among a primary electorate that continues to be infatuated with him.But prevailing wisdom also suggests that Trump doesn’t stand a chance against President Joe Biden in the general election—with some Democrats eager for the opportunity to face him again. Many political analysts instead are fixated on the possibility that Trump will “steal” the election rather than win it outright.This is a mistake. New data confirms that Republicans are increasing their turnout advantage. If Donald Trump is their nominee, he will be far more competitive than many think. After all, his flaws and indictments have done little to push Republicans away.Read more at The Daily Beast.",The Daily Beast,Top,Yes,50.322189966256815,91.28800701406544,99.98919462249997,57.78917291414832,60.69008622559548,68.81094509990588,trump election,{},"{'nominee': 'presidential', 'polls': 'latest', 'competition': 'little', 'electorate': 'primary', 'wisdom': 'prevailing', 'election': 'general', 'analysts': 'political', 'data': 'new'}",0,0

Ron DeSantis (R) stoked controversy after his campaign promoted an ad in late June that attacked former President Donald Trump's past support of the LGBTQ+ community. The original poster deleted the video, however, the DeSantis War Room account's tweet sharing it is still up. https://twitter.com/DeSantisWarRoom/status/1674899610379116546 The controversial video showed Trump saying he would “do everything in my power to protect our LGBTQ citizens” and highlighted his decision to allow a transgender model to compete in a Miss Universe competition when he owned the pageant, in contrast to DeSantis' recent record, which he is using to run against Trump from the right in the 2024 Republican party. The video included a critic calling DeSantis' laws restricting transgender rights as ""draconian."" The Florida governor has signed a slew of anti-trans bills, including a ban gender-affirming care for minors, a ban on children attending drag shows, and school curriculum reforms restricting the inclusion of LGBTQ themes. It also compared DeSantis favorably to fictional serial killer Patrick Bateman. But the video didn't come from a DeSantis fan outside of the campaign as the initial post may have indicated and fans of DeSantis implied as outrage grew. Instead, according to a New York Times report published Sunday, that video was actually ""more of a self-inflicted wound than was previously known."" ""A DeSantis campaign aide had originally produced the video internally, passing it off to an outside supporter to post it first and making it appear as if it was generated independently, according to a person with knowledge of the incident,"" the Times reported. Despite receiving criticism from both sides of aisle, DeSantis defended the premise of the video as ""totally fair game,"" arguing that Trump has flip flopped on LGBTQ-related issues. The video also sparked consternation within DeSantis' anti-trans coalition. After it ran, prominent members of the pro-DeSantis' organization Gays Against Groomers said they would leave the group. The Florida governor has consistently trailed Trump in Republican primary polls. A survey conducted in mid-July shows Trump leading DeSantis by 26 points.

For example, you might tell a child learning to ride a bike for the first time that it’s a lot like balancing on a seesaw.For a while, it was thought that just humans used analogical reasoning to solve problems. However, some new research from psychologists at the University of California, Los Angeles have found that AI chatbots also have the ability to use analogies just like humans.The team published a study Monday in the journal Nature Human Behaviour that found that OpenAI’s large language model GPT-3 performed as well as college students when asked to solve analogy problems like the ones found on tests like the SAT.

2423,Trump,2023-07-31,"""DeSantis drops below Vivek Ramaswamy in online election betting market PredictIt""","Entrepreneur Vivek Ramaswamy may have a better shot at nabbing the Republican presidential nomination than Gov. Ron DeSantis (Fla.), betting site PredictIt indicates. Over the weekend, DeSantis dropped below Ramaswamy on the online gambling service for the first time since the two entered the crowded race, which includes former President Donald Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence.  DeSantis has been in the public eye for years since he took over Florida in 2019 and developed a firebrand personality. Meanwhile, Ramaswamy was relatively unknown when he entered the race and is running an underdog campaign. PredictIt works by having users buy shares in a given candidate’s likelihood of reaching a certain outcome while running for office, somewhat similar to the stock market. For the 2024 presidential nomination, people can invest in any candidate they think will win or lose, even ones who haven’t declared, like Gov. Gavin Newsom (D-Calif.) Users of PredictIt make bets on candidates by buying shares, the price of which is between one dollar and 99 cents per share. On Friday, Ramaswamy reached 19 cents in favor of a win, which was two cents above where DeSantis stood. Ramaswamy then dropped to 17 cents, just barely above DeSantis’ 16 cents, before returning to the current neck-and-neck price with DeSantis at 15 cents. In the past 90 days, bets on DeSantis have hovered in the high 20s and low 30s. Ramaswamy started at just three cents at the end of last month, but quickly ascended to 14 cents in mid-July, as DeSantis has faltered.  Bets have wanted on DeSantis as he continues to lag behind Trump in a new national poll and is stumping on economic policy in New Hampshire. DeSantis’ campaign has been plagued by controversy lately, and he recently shed a third of his staff. He also recently let go an aide who shared a video that included Nazi symbolism. New Zealand political tech company Aristotle launched Predictit in 2014, and it caught the internet’s attention during the 2016 election, providing insight that some say is better than what’s gleaned from polls, which are more a reflection of where voters stand on a candidate at that point in time, not guessing who might win. PredictIt calls on participants to put their money on how people will vote in the future, while also allowing Americans to participate in legal gambling on elections. But it hasn’t always been on the mark. Jeb Bush was pinned as a favorite by betters on the site months before he eventually dropped out after a poor showing in South Carolina. Shortly before the 2020 presidential race was called, PredictIt showed Biden’s chances of winning at 84 percent.  Meanwhile, Ramaswamy is on a victory lap, celebrating his emergence as a leading candidate. He recently reached the unique donor threshold required to appear at the first GOP debate in August and received a standing ovation when he stopped at the Lincoln Day Dinner in Iowa.

The founders of the country created the judiciary as the third branch of the federal government to keep executive power in check and prevent corruption. So it was a cause for deep concern last week when Donald Trump unleashed a verbal tantrum on his Truth Social platform, accusing special counsel Jack Smith of “prosecutorial misconduct” even before he filed four federal criminal counts against the former president over his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election in a bid to remain in office.An identical barrage came last April when a Manhattan grand jury indicted Trump on 34 felony charges for falsifying business records. That time, he also called for defunding the justice department and the FBI, even though the charges did not come from either federal agency. Both reactions were part of a long-running campaign by Trump to undermine the rule of law in the US and dismiss the multiple charges he faces, and has denied, as politically motivated. Even lawyers who once supported Trump have told me that delegitimising the law and the judiciary could destroy the country’s system of government. Yet, even if he is convicted, Trump’s supporters will probably remain loyal to him, convinced that the entire legal system is “rigged” – a favourite Trumpism.

2957,Trump,2023-08-11,"""Why Some Wisconsin Lawmakers and Local Officials Have Changed Their Minds About Letting Undocumented Immigrants Drive""","by Melissa Sanchez ProPublica is a nonprofit newsroom that investigates abuses of power. Sign up for Dispatches, a newsletter that spotlights wrongdoing around the country, to receive our stories in your inbox every week. Leer en español. When Judy Kalepp became the municipal court judge in Abbotsford, Wisconsin, more than a decade ago, she was shocked to see how many Latinos were ticketed for driving without a license. She asked herself: Couldn’t they just get licensed and stop breaking the law? Then she got to know some of the drivers, mostly Mexican immigrants who lived and worked in the community. Despite not speaking Spanish, she was able to communicate with many of them and learn that they were undocumented and prohibited by state law from getting driver’s licenses. Over time, her views changed. While she still worries about road safety with so many unlicensed immigrants driving, she’s also come to recognize how important their labor is to the area around Abbotsford, a Central Wisconsin town that’s home to a meatpacking facility and is surrounded by dairy farms. “The more I see of it,” Kalepp said, “the more I think we’re probably wrong in not allowing them to get a license.” Last week ProPublica reported on how Wisconsin, a state that bills itself as “America’s Dairyland,” relies on undocumented immigrants to work on its dairy farms but doesn’t let them drive. As a result, many undocumented dairy workers struggle to take care of some of their most basic needs — from buying groceries and cashing in checks to visiting the doctor or taking their kids to school. They say they are trapped on the farms where they work and often live, dependent on others to take them where they need to go. Immigrants who break the law and drive anyway risk getting ticketed and receiving hefty fines or even being arrested or deported. “It’s scary to drive,” said an undocumented Honduran immigrant who works on a farm near Abbotsford. He’s lived mostly in isolation in his 10 years in Wisconsin: He’s never visited Milwaukee, he rarely sees friends from back home (they can’t legally drive either), and he doesn’t know how or when he’d ever meet a romantic partner. But he still gets behind the wheel six days a week to get to work — and then again every two weeks to go into town to cash his check, buy groceries and do his laundry. “To get anything done,” he said, “you have to drive.” For years, advocates for immigrants have tried to persuade lawmakers in Wisconsin to allow undocumented immigrants to get driver’s licenses. Democrats have been mostly on board, with Gov. Tony Evers inserting the issue into his budget proposals. The challenge has been convincing Republicans, who control the state Legislature, to take an action that some of their constituents might fiercely oppose. “I have some Republican voters and Republican colleagues that say, ‘Hey, they came here illegally. They didn’t come here through legal channels, so they shouldn’t be rewarded,’” said Rep. Patrick Snyder, a GOP lawmaker whose district sits a little to the east of Abbotsford and includes parts of Marathon County. “I understand their concerns. But in the same sense, if we suddenly kicked out all of the people here, the undocumented, our dairy farms would collapse. We have to come up with a solution.” Snyder is one of a number of Republican lawmakers and local officials from the area who met with law enforcement officials, dairy farmers, civic leaders and immigration rights advocates in Abbotsford in March to discuss the impact on the community of a 2006 law banning undocumented immigrants from obtaining driver’s licenses. Wisconsin is one of 31 states that doesn’t allow undocumented immigrants to drive legally. The meeting in Abbotsford, which straddles the border of Clark and Marathon counties, offers a window into how the politics around this issue might be changing. Some local officials who live in these places and routinely interact with undocumented immigrant drivers or hear from local dairy farmers are becoming more vocal about changing the law. Like much of rural Wisconsin, both counties voted solidly in 2020 for then-President Donald Trump, whose stance against illegal immigration was a hallmark of his presidency. Abbotsford, with a population of about 2,100, has a downtown that’s lined with Mexican restaurants and grocery stores. Local residents and dairy workers from around the area drive in to cash their checks, buy tortillas and other staples from back home, and go to the municipal court to pay their tickets for driving without a license. This $124 citation is, by far, the most common processed in the municipal court, accounting for nearly one in three cases that ended with a guilty disposition and more than $19,000 in fines last year, records show. The court does not track defendants’ race or ethnicity, but ProPublica found that 134 of the 157 tickets for driving without a valid license involved defendants with common Hispanic surnames, such as Cruz, Lopez and Garcia. (The U.S. Census Bureau says more than 85% of people with these last names are Hispanic.) Jason Bauer, the chief of the Colby-Abbotsford Police Department, said he wishes the state would allow undocumented immigrants to get trained and tested to get driver’s licenses. But in the meantime, he said, he can’t tell his officers to stop enforcing the law when they encounter a driver without a license. “Then I’d have to say, ‘You’ve got to treat everybody the same,” he said, “including the 15-year-old white kids” who are driving. Still, tickets for driving without a license are so common that Bauer has asked his officers to stop seeking criminal charges on repeat offenses — which is what typically happens — to help drivers avoid mandatory court appearances. Bauer said he also wants to avoid overwhelming his local county district attorneys. (Melissa Inlow, Clark County’s district attorney, said she stopped pressing criminal charges on repeat offenses for driving without a license last fall due to limited resources, but drivers still have to pay a fine.) Abbotsford Mayor Jim Weix said he talks to Bauer several times a week and knows just how frequently drivers are ticketed for this offense. Weix is a Republican who backs Trump and supports tougher border policies. But he doesn’t think the current state law, which lets undocumented immigrants own cars but prohibits them from driving, makes sense. “We need these people to learn how to drive and our rules and regulations and everything,” Weix said. But like many fellow Republicans, Weix worries about voter fraud and said he wouldn’t want undocumented immigrants to use driver’s licenses to vote illegally. Since Wisconsin residents can use driver’s licenses as proof of ID for voting, he would urge lawmakers to ensure that any type of driver’s license that’s created for undocumented immigrants be clearly marked “not to be used for voting.” At the March meeting, law enforcement officials expressed concern about having so many people on the road who haven’t passed a local driving test. “That’s a danger. We want to keep roads safe,” Clark County Sheriff Scott Haines said in an interview. “I am looking more for the safety of all citizens.” Haines said the meeting opened his eyes to the issue’s complexities. But he said changing the law “is out of our hands.” Like Bauer, he said that unless the Legislature allows undocumented immigrants to get licenses, he has to enforce the law. Dairy farmers at the meeting spoke about how the state law makes it difficult for their workers to get to and from work without risking tickets and arrest. Among the farmers: Hans Breitenmoser, who operates a 470-cow farm in Lincoln County, northeast of Abbotsford. “Dairy cows are 24/7,” Breitenmoser said in an interview. “I don’t have the luxury of just shutting down the machines. We have to milk them every single day, three times a day. If someone doesn’t show up it’s kind of a big deal compared to in other industries; we’re dealing with live creatures.” ProPublica reached out to the four Republican lawmakers who attended, as identified by the meeting’s organizers and other attendees. Sen. Jesse James declined to comment, though he recently told Wisconsin Public Radio he would be open to considering legislation to give undocumented immigrants access to driver’s licenses. Rep. Calvin Callahan did not respond to interview requests. But in a June press release, he explained how Republicans had removed “liberal wish list” items from the governor’s budget proposal, including driver’s licenses and other “new benefits for illegal immigrants.” Meanwhile, Snyder and Rep. Donna Rozar, whose district includes Abbotsford, said they’d support legislation restoring driving privileges to undocumented immigrants in Wisconsin. But both acknowledged it’d be a tough sell to some of their Republican colleagues. The real problem, they said, is Congress’ failure to fix the country’s broken immigration system. “There are a lot of us that believe we’re being invaded and the federal government doesn’t care,” Rozar said. “And I get the sense that some of my colleagues believe that if we start chipping away at this undocumented worker issue, we are taking some of the responsibility away from the federal government to do their job.” Maryam Jameel contributed reporting.",Propublica,Top,Yes,52.80625086412173,60.69514415714539,37.94327391488845,80.44580951651767,57.22361247461672,81.79771279799749,wisconsin lawmakers,{},"{'newsroom': 'nonprofit', 'court': 'municipal', 'immigrants': 'undocumented', 'week': 'last', 'workers': 'undocumented', 'needs': 'basic', 'fines': 'hefty', 'immigrant': 'honduran', 'partner': 'romantic', 'voters': 'republican', 'colleagues': 'republican', 'channels': 'legal', 'sense': 'same', 'lawmakers': 'republican', 'officials': 'local', 'leaders': 'civic', 'drivers': 'undocumented', 'farmers': 'local', 'immigration': 'illegal', 'restaurants': 'mexican', 'residents': 'local', 'staples': 'other', 'home': 'back', 'disposition': 'guilty', 'year': 'last', 'license': 'valid', 'surnames': 'hispanic', 'names': 'last', 'kids': 'white', 'charges': 'criminal', 'appearances': 'mandatory', 'attorneys': 'local', 'fall': 'last', 'resources': 'limited', 'times': 'several', 'policies': 'tougher', 'law': 'current', 'people': 'many', 'test': 'local', 'day': 'single', 'deal': 'big', 'industries': 'other', 'creatures': 'live', 'attendees': 'other', 'list': 'liberal', 'benefits': 'new', 'privileges': 'driving', 'sell': 'tough', 'problem': 'real', 'system': 'broken', 'government': 'federal', 'issue': 'undocumented'}",0,0

The documents, first reported by the New York Times, urged DeSantis ""to take a sledgehammer” to Vivek Ramaswamy, the Republican entrepreneur who has slowly been gaining in the polls. Dub the primary opponent ""Fake Vivek"" or ""Vivek the Fake,"" the memo advised. Ramaswamy responded to the report Thursday afternoon, who called it ""another boring, establishment attack from Super PAC-creation 'Robot Ron' who is literally taking lame, pre-programmed attack lines against me for next week’s debate."" https://twitter.com/VivekGRamaswamy/status/1692202661410750526 The strategy documents indicate that DeSantis' campaign may view Ramaswamy as his biggest threat at the Aug. 23 debate, given that former President Donald Trump is not expected to participate. Ramaswamy, a political newcomer, has recently been closing the gap between him and DeSantis. A RealClearPolitics polling average between July 23-Aug. 15 shows Ramaswamy in third place with 6.7%, about eight points behind DeSantis. That's a 4.3-point increase for Ramaswamy in the last two months, compared to a 5.4-point decrease for DeSantis. And Ramaswamy is polling ahead of former Vice President Mike Pence, Nikki Haley, Sen. Tim Scott (R-S.C.), and Chris Christie—all of whom had bigger name recognition coming into the race than Ramaswamy. While the debate memo also encouraged DeSantis to defend Trump in absentia from attacks wielded by Christie, Trump has celebrated DeSantis' drop in polls, referencing a recent survey by RMG Research. The polling firm holds a B- rating from FiveThirtyEight. ""It’s over for Ron DeSanctimonious, now in 3rd place. Ramaswamy now in 2nd,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social Wednesday. ""RMG Research.

They sat stony-faced amid much nervous foot-shuffling and laughter as the chairman, the former president of Mozambique, Joaquim Chissano (one of the few African leaders who stood down when his time was up), pointed at them and said, “And we all know who Kofi was talking about, don’t we?” It was an electric moment.Annan may have been talking about African presidents, but today his words might equally apply elsewhere. Is it not extraordinary that, more than 200 years after it was founded, a political system as open and allegedly sophisticated as that in the US can only offer the American electorate a choice between two elderly males – one a serial liar and the other a decent man well past his sell-by date. One can understand what drives Donald Trump (77) – a desire to stay out of prison – but why on earth should Joe Biden (80), who has held elected office since 1972, want to cling to power? And not just Biden; what of Nancy Pelosi (83), until recently House speaker, or the Senate Republican leader, Mitch McConnell (81), both visibly fading?

But although Sound of Freedom has, as of this weekend, taken nearly $178m (£139m), it is a particularly unlikely “surprise smash hit of the summer”. Had it been released five years ago, as originally intended, this mid-budget thriller might have sunk without trace. Instead, it has struck gold in these politically polarised, conspiracy-theory-addled times, boosted by Donald Trump, Fox News and the religious right, not to mention adherents of the wacko QAnon conspiracy theory. After its triumphant US run, it is now set for release internationally, including in the UK next week.Ostensibly based on the true story of a US agent’s rogue mission to rescue trafficked children from Latin America, Sound of Freedom plays like a mix of Sicario, Taken and Rambo, albeit with a more earnest and subdued tone.

He played Trump 2.0 on the scene by fiercely interrupting other candidates and constantly referring to himself as the “not bought by corporate money politician.” Ramaswamy’s strategy was clearly a nod to the front-runner of the Republican primary, Donald Trump, who also started his 2016 campaign by saying, “I’m so rich I can’t be bought.” Ramaswamy might be the first candidate I’ve ever seen to imitate the ignorant arrogance of Trump and then quickly switch lanes and say, “I’m a skinny kid with a funny name,” clearly a nod to former president Barack Obama’s 2004 DNC speech where he introduced himself to the nation. But Ramaswamy’s policy plans, like Trump’s, are insidious; Ramaswamy wants to completely dismantle the foundations our country was built on.Two of the most significant policy ideas Ramaswamy’s constantly been pushing—rescinding birthright citizenship and elevating the voting age from 18 to 25—reveal a profound commitment to overhauling fundamental aspects of our Constitution.
